Testkube supports running trace-based tests with Tracetest.

<ExecutorInfo />

By using the Testkube Tracetest Executor you can now add Tracetest to the native CI/CD pipeline in your Kubernetes cluster. This allows you to add all the additional Testkube functionalities, like running scheduled test runs and using Test Triggers. All while following the trace-based testing principle and enabling full in-depth assertions against trace data, not just the response.

## **Running a Tracetest Test**

In order to run Tracetest tests using Testkube, you will need to have the following in your Kubernetes cluster:
1. Testkube
2. Tracetest
3. An OpenTelemetry Instrumented Service

To install Tracetest, refer to
[Tracetest's documentation](https://docs.tracetest.io/getting-started/installation/). 

To create the test in Testkube, you'll need to export your Tracetest `Test Definition`. An example of an exported Tracetest definition looks like the following:

```yaml
type: Test
spec:
  id: RUkKQ_aVR
  name: Pokeshop - List
  description: Get a Pokemon
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      url: http://demo-pokemon-api.demo/pokemon?take=20&skip=0
      method: GET
      headers:
      - key: Content-Type
        value: application/json
  specs:
  - name: Database queries less than 500 ms
    selector: span[tracetest.span.type="database"]
    assertions:
    - attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  500ms
```

### **Add Test to Testkube**

To add your Tracetest tests to Testkube, use the `create test` command. You'll need to reference the `.yaml` file for your test definitions using the `--file` argument and the Tracetest Server endpoint using the `--variable` argument with `TRACETEST_ENDPOINT`.

Your Tracetest Endpoint should be reachable by Testkube in your cluster. Use your Tracetest service's `CLUSTER-IP:PORT`, for example: `10.96.93.106:11633`.

```bash
kubectl testkube create test --file ./test.yaml --type "tracetest/test" --name tracetest-test --variable TRACETEST_ENDPOINT=http://CLUSTER-IP:PORT
```

```sh title="Expected output:"
Test created testkube / tracetest-test ðŸ¥‡
```

### **Running Tracetest Tests in Testkube**

To execute the test, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl testkube run test --watch tracetest-test
```

Alternatively, you can also run the test from the Testkube Dashboard.

### **Getting Test Results**

If the test passes, the Testkube CLI will look like this:

```sh title="Expected output:"
