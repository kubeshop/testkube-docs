## What is Testkube?

Testkube is a Test Orchestration and Execution Framework powered by Kubernetes. It provides a single
platform for defining, running and analyzing test executions, using your existing testing tools/scripts,
running in your existing infrastructure.

Testkube consists of a **Control Plane** and any number of **Testkube Agents**. The Control Plane exposes
a **Dashboard** for easy and centralized access to most Testkube features.

- The Control Plane can be running either in the cloud or on-prem - [Read more](articles/install/deployment-architectures).
- The Agents run your tests and are _always_ running in your own infrastructure.
- The Agent is 100% Open Source and can also be run standalone without the Control Plane - [Read more](articles/open-source-or-pro).
