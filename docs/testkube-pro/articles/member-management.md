# Member Management

Manage your organization members from the [Members] option in the Organization management panel:

:::note
This document describes high-level member management within an Organization, please 
check out [Resource Access Management](/articles/resource-access-management) to get an overview of how Testkube
allows you to manage and apply Resource Access controls for Organization Members.

## Member Types

Testkube allows you to license for two type types of members; **full** and **read-only**. A members' type 
is implicit and based on if that member has been given write-access to any resource/environment in Testkube: 
- A member that has been given write-access automatically counts as a full member.
- A member that does not have any write-access counts as read-only.

You can see the number of used/available seats of each type in the members page:

![Fixed Member Limits](images/fixed-member-limits.png)

### Rules / Constraints 

This model imposes some constraints related to member types and permissions:

- It is not possible to give an existing read-only member write-access to any resource or environment, 
  either directly or indirectly, if no full-member seats are available.
- When giving a read-only member write access to any resource or environment, and full-member seats are available, 
  that member will automatically count to the full member quota instead.
- It is not possible to invite a member (or accept an invitation) if all member seats are occupied. 
- For on-prem/SSO-enabled deployments, new members will not be able to sign in if no seats are available.
- Members who are read-only will count to the full-member limit if there aren't enough read-only seats available.

### Member licensing with the Testkube Cloud Control Plane

When using the Testkube Cloud Control Plane instead of hosting the Control Plane on-prem, members can be
licensed either within a fixed limit, or based on active member count at the end of each month.

- **Fixed** members licensing allocates a fixed number of full and read-only members to your organization, for which
  you will be billed in your billing cycle.
- **Pay-as-you-go** member licensing counts the number of members at the end of each 
  billing cycle and bills you for that number of members. Please note that Pay-as-you-go licensing always invoices 
  all members as full members even if there might a certain number of read-only members at a given point in time. 
  Pay-as-you-go licensing is indicated by an infinity-sign in the number of members count:

:::info
Cloud Control Plane Trials have a 3 full and 5 read-only member limit by default.

## Inviting Members

Invite new members from the Members page by specifying: 
- Emails - a comma-separated list of emails to invite.
- Role - there are 4 roles for organization members:
  - `Owner` - Has access to all environments and organization settings, also can access billing details.
  - `Admin` - Has access to all environments and organization settings.
  - `Member` - Access to Resource Groups and Environments is defined by the roles assigned to given member. 
  - `Biller` - Has access to billing details only.
- Teams - which Teams the invited members should belong to.
- Environments - which Environments the invited members should be added to, with their corresponding Environment Role

:::note
A new member will not have access to any resources or environments and will initially count as a read-only
member (see above) unless default permissions have been assigned via [SCIM](/testkube-pro-on-prem/articles/scim) 
or [bootstrap member mapping](/articles/install/advanced-install#bootstrap-member-mapping). 

See [Resource Access Management](/articles/resource-access-management) to learn how to give members access to 
environments and resources.
::::

Once all specified, select the Invite button in the bottom right.

:::tip
For Testkube On-Prem deployments you can configure default organizations, environments and roles for users - see 
[Bootstrap User Mapping](/articles/install/advanced-install#bootstrap-member-mapping).
