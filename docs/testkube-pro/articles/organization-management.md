GREEN status means that your agent is connected successfully. 

In the case of a RED status, you can try to debug the issues with the command below:

```sh
testkube agent debug
```

Run this on your cluster where the given agent is installed.

### Inviting Members

Invite new members by specifying 
- Emails - a comma-separated list of emails to invite.
- Role - there are 4 roles for organization members:
  - `Owner` - Has access to all environments and organization settings, also can access billing details.
  - `Admin` - Has access to all environments and organization settings.
  - `Member` - Has limited access to environments, access is defined by the roles assigned to given member. Member by default doesn't have any access, you need to [explicitly set it in the given environment](environment-management.md).
  - `Biller` - Has access to billing details only.
- Teams - which Teams the invited members should belong to.
- Environments - which Environments the invited members should be added to, with their corresponding Environment Role

Once all specified, select the Invite button in the bottom right.
