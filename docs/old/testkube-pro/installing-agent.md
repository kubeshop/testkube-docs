# Installing the Testkube Agent

Following steps, are under the assumption that you already have a Testkube Pro account, if that's not the case, 
you can find a detailed description about how to get started with Testkube [here](/articles/tutorial/quickstart).

## Installation Steps

1. To add a new agent, create a new environment: 

![Create Environment](../../img/creating-environment.jpeg)

![Pass Info](../../img/pass-info.png)


2. Fill in the environment name:

3. Copy the Helm install command into your terminal to install the environment and deploy the Testkube agent in your cluster: 

![Copy Helm Command](../../img/copy-helm-command.png)

4. Run the command in your terminal.

You will need *Helm* installed and `kubectl` configured with access to your Kubernetes cluster: 
- To install `helm` just follow the [install instructions on the Helm web site](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- To install `kubectl` follow [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

5. When the install is complete, you will see the Helm installation notice:

## Validating the Installation 

Testkube Pro will notify if the installation is successful. 

* A green indicator means that your cluster was able to connect to the Testkube Pro.
* A red indicator indicates that the Testkube Agent can't connect to the Testkube Pro API (Testkube needs some time to establish a connection, max time is 2-3 minutes).

In the case of a RED status you can try to debug the issues with the command below:

```sh 
testkube agent debug
```

By default, Testkube is installed in the `testkube` namespace.
