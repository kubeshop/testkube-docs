## Monthly Release v1.20.0 (2025-11-03)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.326.0.

### What's new!

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Endpoint on Control Plane**
Building on the MCP Server introduced in v1.18,
you can now connect AI assistants directly to dedicated MCP endpoints on your Testkube environments,
no local CLI server required.

Configure your AI assistant (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Desktop) with your environment’s MCP endpoint URL and an API key,
and you’re ready to go.

Through this integration, AI agents can not only run workflows, monitor executions, analyze results,
and search execution history, but also modify workflows, access resource metrics for deeper performance and resource analysis,
and work directly with agents for advanced orchestration, all through natural conversation in your coding environment.

More info can be found in the [MCP Server](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/mcp-overview) page in the docs.

**Silent Executions**
Run workflows and tests quietly when you don’t want activity to affect your analytics or automation signals.
Silent Executions are now supported directly from the UI
and allow you to execute tests without persisting results in Insights, generating metrics, triggering CDEvents or webhooks, or impacting workflow health.

This is ideal for local development, debugging pipelines, experimenting with configuration changes, or running internal verification checks -
without polluting dashboards, reports, or automation workflows.

More info can be found in the [Silent Executions](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/test-workflows-running#silent-executions) section in the **Running Test Workflows** docs.

**Enhanced Credentials Management**
Managing sensitive values in Testkube just got easier.
We’ve introduced a unified credentials experience with improved organization- and environment-scoped credential handling,
along with dedicated management screens in both organization and environment settings.

You can now create plaintext or encrypted credentials and reference them directly in workflows using the `credentials()` expression,
making secure secret handling both intuitive and flexible across your Testkube environments.

More info can be found in the [Credentials Management](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/credential-management) page in the docs.

## Monthly Release v1.19.0 (2025-10-01)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.325.0.

### What's new!

**Concurrency & Queue Policies.**
This release adds new functionality to manage the concurrency and reliability of executions, allowing you to control the number of executions that can run
simultaneously across a single or a group of workflows. This helps you ensure that the number of tests running is always in line with the capacity of
both your testing infrastructure and the system-under-test.

**Runner Concurrency Limits** allow you to prevent overwhelming your runners with too many concurrent test executions. Whenever a concurrency threshold is met,
the execution will be queued until previous executions finish. Since the execution queue might fill up due to these concurrency features or because no online and
matching runners can be found, **Environment Queue Limits** help to prevent your workspace from getting overwhelmed. Once this limit is hit, executions will immediately
abort which will also trigger its web hooks for alerting. Lastly, **Execution Time-outs** will abort queued and ongoing executions respectively after 1 day and 7 days
with further fail-safes when runners are unable to gracefully abort.

[Read more about Concurrency & Queueing](/articles/test-workflows-concurrency-queueing)

**Listener Agents.**
This release introduces the concept of [Listener Agents](/articles/agents-overview#listener-agents) that allow you to listen for TestTriggers in multiple namespaces/clusters within a single Testkube Environment.
We added, a new `selector` field for Test Triggers enables agent-based filtering so you can filter out events from specific Agents and run triggers only in selected environments.

Under the hood, this release introduces a new capabilities model for the Testkube Agent that gives you granular control over how agents operate. Newly created agents can
register with runner and/or listener capabilities to fit your architecture.

[Read more about Agents](/articles/agents-overview)

### Improvements and fixes

- Improved overall filter handling to be consistent across workflows/templates and dashboard executions.
- TestWorkflows: Added support for dynamic runtime environment variable overrides via the `--variable` CLI flag.
- On-Prem: Fixed an issue where inactive SCIM users were incorrectly counted towards license quotas.
- Improved Agents page. You can view and install agents with different capabilities.
- Added OpenTelemetry Tracing to the Control Plane.

### Architectural Improvements

The team is working on some exciting architectural updates to make Testkube more scalable and reliable. Starting from this release, the
internal scheduling is changing from a push-based to a pull-based architecture. You should not notice much from this change, likely things
become more reliable when the connection between the control plane and agents is flaky. Another benefit is that this sits closer to Kubernetes
architecture, which will open interesting opportunities in the future. Stay tuned!

### What's new!

Latest release is live, bringing personalized views, streamlined enterprise integrations, and new AI assistant capabilities that let tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude directly interact with your test workflows.

**Private filters** let you **create personalized filter sets that only you can see**, separate from shared team filters. Access and manage your private filters through the new navbar section without affecting what others see.

**SCIM 2.0 enterprise integration** is now **fully multi-tenant and available on SaaS** for the first time. Configure identity provider integrations (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) **directly from Organization Management > Product Features** - no more Helm changes or service restarts needed for on-prem users.

**New Testkube MCP Server** enables **AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Desktop) to directly run and monitor Test Workflows**, analyze results, search execution history, and create workflows. AI agents can now help automate debugging and identify failing patterns right from your coding environment. [Learn more in the docs →](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/mcp-overview)

### Improvements and fixes

- Added dynamic filtering system that shows only available options based on current data to reduce interface clutter.
- CLI: Added support for SSO login, allowing users to authenticate the Testkube CLI with their organization’s identity provider.
- Agent Metrics: Expanded Prometheus metrics for Test Workflows and Execution Steps. Workflow execution metrics now include [additional fields](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/metrics#executions) (`triggered_by`, `tags`) for richer filtering and analysis, while new metrics for step-level duration and counts provide deeper visibility into execution details.
- Updated Usage & Billing page for SaaS product.

## Monthly Release v1.17.1 (2025-07-29)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.323.1.

### What's new!

This release focuses on usability improvements, better observability, and more powerful reuse of workflow templates.

You can now **filter workflow executions on the dashboard by name, labels, or status**, making it easier to focus on relevant runs during debugging, monitoring, or audits.

**Workflow Templates** now support **runner agent targeting** directly in the template spec. This allows you to define which Runner Agents should execute your workflows once, and reuse that logic across environments and pipelines. [Learn more in the docs →](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/test-workflows#runner-agent-target)

### Improvements and fixes

- Added workflow health status to the `status` subresource of the Workflow object, aligning with Kubernetes best practices and improving accessibility.
- Added `Canceled` and `Not Passed` events to provide better differentiation between manual stops and failed validations.
- Enabled verbose logging for the Control Plane API and added debug mode for Worker Service (`testkube-worker-service.enableDebugMode=true` in Helm values).
- Both `testkube-agent` and `testkube-runner` Helm charts are now being published to the OCI registry. They will remain accessible via the original Helm repository as well.
- Simplified network configuration by using the default Ingress for WebSockets used by clients. The separate WebSocket Ingress can safely be removed without requiring other changes.

## Monthly Release v1.16.1 (2025-06-26)

This release is available in Helm Chart v2.322.1.

### What's new!

This release comes with a new way to deploy Runner Agents and several improvements to workflows.

You can now install a Runner Agent using only Helm. Previously a Runner Agent had to be registered using the CLI or UI prior to Helm install. This feature can be used to create Runner Agents for ephemeral environments in a single step. [Documentation is available here](/articles/multi-agent-runner-helm-chart#self-registering-runner-agent-helm-install).

Users can now create custom views to group workflows by any criteria, making it easier to organize workflows that belong together or quickly access frequently used filtered results. These views are shared between all the users of a given environment.

We've added a [new Workflow Health indicator](/articles/workflow-health) that shows a quick visual summary of a workflow's recent stability, helping users understand how reliably it's been running over time, not just surfacing flakiness, but overall consistency. The health score is calculated as PassRate x (1 - FlipRate) and shown as an icon next to each workflow in both list and detail views, using weather-style visuals to represent different health levels.

We've introduced a new Canceled status to distinguish manual cancellations from system-level Aborted executions. Previously, both were marked as Aborted. With updated icons and messaging, users can now clearly see if a test Failed, was Aborted (system error), or Canceled (manual action).

Testkube Copilot has been renamed to Testkube AI Assistant to better reflect its purpose and avoid confusion with similarly named tools. This makes it clearer that the assistant is purpose-built for the Testkube ecosystem.

### Improvements and fixes

- Workflows search - Revised the way search works. You can now search for workflows using multiple words separated by spaces. The search matches when all the words are contained in the workflow name.
- CLI Artifact Download - Fixed authentication problems with certain cloud providers due to presence of duplicate authentication mechanism.
- Executions Logs - Improved horizontal scrolling for long logs.
- Insights - Fixed an issue where saving changes to an existing report saved a new one instead which led to duplicates.

- Fixed an issue where the correct JUnit test suite icon wasn't displaying properly
- Improved the timestamps displayed within execution details when workflows are still queued.
- Improved handling of JUnit format when working with nested test suites
- Resolved a problem with empty string default values in workflow config settings
- Enhanced the agents dropdown for better usability
- Fixed an issue where your selected agents weren't being preserved when running workflows
- Corrected broken links in the running context that weren't properly directing to workflows
- Fixed a search error that occurred when searching for empty or non-existent values in execution logs
- Resolved a critical security vulnerability (F-2025-4481) related to OAuth account hijacking via redirect URLs
- Strengthened security headers in our nginx configuration for better protection

### What changed?

Release Quality has been our focus for Testkube v1.15.
This release is packed with a variety of bug fixes and improvements.

Our team also took a good look at the release procedures of the Testkube Control Plane:

- Changelogs! Testkube's control plane now comes with public changelogs and a unified version.
  In the past, each service such as the dashboard, API Server, workers, etc, would have its own version.
  Today they all share the same version which makes it easier to communicate changes and service interoperability.
- The release cadence will also be reduced to better fit enterprises. Moving forward you can expect a monthly minor release with some unplanned patch versions in between. The new process also improves predictability and stability of these releases.
- Our Helm Chart is now available as an OCI Artifact. The old Helm Repository approach still works, but under the hood it will now also pull as an OCI Artifact.

### Features

- Added timezone to TestWorkflows cronjobs.
- Added support for logging Audit Events to console.

### Improvements & fixes

- Fixed variety of security issues.
- Added downloading of an execution's log to the dashboard.
- Fixed an issue with preview URLs when changing environments.
- Fixed an issue with legacy tests events for the webhook condition selector
- Fixed an issue with full screen mode within execution dialogue.
- Fixed a problem where workingDir were incorrectly substituted within workflow definitions.
- Fixed an issue updating team and board descriptions.
- Fixed workflow termination when resource metrics cannot be stored due to lack of free storage space.
  Improved user interface of multi-agent engine
- Many other minor fixes and improvements.
