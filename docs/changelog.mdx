## Monthly Release v2.7.0 (Planned)

Control Plane and Agent continue with unified versioning in `2.7.x`.

### What's new!

**Control Plane becomes default source of truth for connected environments**

Starting in `v2.7`, orchestration ownership moves to the Control Plane by default for connected environments.
For most users, this means workflow and schedule management is now centered in Control Plane with no workflow changes required.
Environment health no longer depends on continuous SuperAgent connectivity, and environments no longer automatically enter read-only mode when that connection is unavailable.

On upgrade, the Agent executes the SuperAgent migration to align existing environments with the new source-of-truth model.

**Workflow sync behavior changed (GitOps opt-in)**

Workflow CRDs are no longer synced from Kubernetes.
If your team manages workflows as CRDs, enable and validate GitOps capability/agent flow so Git-managed CRD updates continue to reconcile as expected.

**Scheduling ownership moved to Control Plane**

Scheduled Workflows are now managed by the Control Plane by default in connected deployments.

### Observability updates

A large set of SuperAgent Prometheus metrics is now available in Control Plane.

Read more: [Control Plane Metrics](/articles/control-plane-metrics)

### Improvements and fixes

- Removed the deprecated native Slack integration configuration from Helm values: `slackToken`, `slackSecret`, and `slackConfig`.
- Slack notifications should now be configured with Testkube Webhooks - [Read more](/articles/slack-integration).
- Extended support in JUnit visualization for non-numeric time values, such as 200ms, 2s, 0.2m, and 0.2h.
- Update MongoDB image and helm chart to use latest patch version available, MongoDB version `8.2.5`.
- Update PostgreSQL image and helm chart to use latest patch version available, PostgreSQL version `18.2`.

## Patch Release v2.6.3 (2026-02-17)

This release focuses on stability fixes in backend and dashboard components, MongoDB index correctness for soft-deleted agents, and AI service Helm configuration improvements.

Control Plane is available in Helm chart vv2.329.3 and Agent is available in Helm chart v2.6.2 ([Check its release notes](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/releases/tag/2.6.2)).

### Security Updates

- Updated Go modules to address reported CVEs and Docker Scout findings.
- Upgraded `go-jose` lineage to `v2.6.3` (`gopkg.in/square/go-jose.v2` replacement and dependency updates) as part of the CVE remediation set.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a panic path by updating the `testkube` dependency to include upstream handling for nil metric timestamps.
- Corrected cloud plan user quota behavior so enterprise-named plans in cloud mode no longer incorrectly appear as unlimited users.
- Fixed agent uniqueness behavior with soft deletes by introducing partial unique indexes for `name` and `secret` and adding a migration to drop/recreate conflicting indexes.
- Improved MongoDB migration/index handling by tolerating missing collection/index cases and tightening partial-index filter matching.
- Fixed AI PostgreSQL DSN precedence in Helm: `db.secretRef` now takes precedence over `db.url` and `global.postgres.dsn`, and missing DB configuration now fails fast at template render time.
  - Adjusted DSN resolution logic in the Testkube Enterprise Helm chart, specifically AI component, to correctly prioritize AI-specific PostgreSQL configuration over global defaults. This ensures the AI service uses its dedicated database settings when provided.
  - Enhanced PostgreSQL configuration in the Testkube Enterprise Helm chart, specifically AI component, by allowing SSL mode to be configured via optional query parameters in the DSN. This provides greater flexibility for different database setups and environments.
- Restored TestWorkflow YAML editor capabilities in the dashboard (schema validation, hover, autocomplete) by stabilizing Monaco YAML worker lifecycle and compatibility.
- Fixed Monaco editor toolbar actions by forwarding refs through lazy-loaded Monaco wrappers.
- Added guards in workflow settings to handle malformed template/workflow entities without runtime failures.

### Features and Improvements

- Added global Helm setting `global.aiApiSubdomain` in cloud API values to support AI API subdomain configuration.
- Made AI service PostgreSQL SSL mode configurable when using `db.secretRef` by adding `db.queryParams` (instead of hardcoding `sslmode=disable`).

## Monthly Release v2.6.0 (2026-02-05)

This release is available in Helm chart v2.329.0. Control Plane and Agent versions are now unified at **v2.6.0**.

:::note Version Unification
Starting with this release, we've consolidated the Control Plane and Agent versioning to share the same major and minor version numbers.
Patch versions may differ between components as fixes are released independently, but the major.minor version (e.g., 2.6.x) will be kept in sync, making it easier to track compatibility across your Testkube deployment.
:::

:::warning Breaking Change
If you were using the AI Assistant in a previous release, you must now configure a PostgreSQL database for the AI service to function.
The AI service uses PostgreSQL to persist conversation state and session data for the new AI Agents feature.

[Read more about the AI Functionality in Testkube](/articles/testkube-ai-overview)
:::

### What's new!

**AI Agents for Test Orchestration**

Testkube now supports **custom AI Agents** that can autonomously execute complex testing tasks with human oversight.
This is a major evolution from the previous AI Assistant which was limited to read-only Q&A and navigation help.

AI Agents bring true agentic capabilities to your testing platform:

- **Create Custom AI Agents**: Define agents with custom instructions tailored to your testing workflows — from "Debug failing E2E tests" to "Generate load test reports" or "Monitor flaky test patterns."
- **Connect External MCP Servers**: Extend agent capabilities by connecting any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This lets agents access external tools, documentation services, or custom integrations alongside Testkube's built-in tools.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Approval**: Agents pause before executing sensitive operations (like creating workflows or modifying resources) and request your approval. You can approve or respond with alternative instructions.
- **Multi-turn Sessions**: Agents maintain conversation context across multiple interactions. Continue a debugging session later, or have the agent iterate on a complex task over time.
- **AI Assistant Integration**: The dashboard AI Assistant (now read-only) can delegate requests to AI Agent sessions.

**Example Use Cases:**

- **Automated Remediation** — Analyze failed tests, identify root causes, and suggest or apply fixes automatically (see [Example](/articles/remediation-agent))
- **Intelligent Analysis** — Detect flaky tests, analyze execution patterns, and surface anomalies (see [Example](/articles/flakiness-analysis-agent))
- **Custom Workflows** — Define agents tailored to your specific testing needs and integrate with external systems

AI Agents are available from the dashboard and can be configured per environment with granular control over which tools are enabled and which require approval before execution.

[Read more about the AI Agents feature](/articles/ai-agents)

**New MCP Server Tools**

The Testkube MCP Server now includes powerful new tools for querying and exploring your test data:

- **`query_workflows`** and **`query_executions`**: Use JSONPath expressions to extract specific data from multiple workflows or executions at once. Query patterns like `$..image` to find all container images across workflows, or `$.result.steps.*` to analyze step results across executions.
- **`get_workflow_schema`** and **`get_execution_schema`**: Retrieve the full YAML schema for TestWorkflow definitions and execution data. These tools help AI assistants understand the complete data structure when creating, updating, or analyzing workflows and results.

These tools make it easier for AI assistants to perform bulk analysis and generate insights across your test infrastructure.

### Improvements and fixes

- Workflows can now be configured as silent at the Workflow level by setting `spec.execution.silent` to true, which will
  result in all executions being silent by default - [Read more about Silent Workflows](/articles/test-workflows-running#silent-workflows)
- On-prem customers can now configure custom LLM models via Helm instead of being locked to defaults.
- AI service now uses two model types: a primary model for complex agent tasks and a lightweight model for quick tasks like generating session titles.
- Default models updated to `gpt-5.2` (primary) and `gpt-5-mini` (lightweight), with optional temperature settings for models that support it.
- Control Plane scheduler improvements: synchronized MongoDB and PostgreSQL implementations, resolved race conditions during test workflow execution scheduling.
- Added scheduler metrics to improve scheduler observability and monitoring - [Read more about Scheduler Metrics](/articles/control-plane-metrics)
- Fixed an issue where the member details view did not correctly show permissions inherited from resource groups.

## Patch Release (2025-12-23)

Control Plane is available in Helm chart v2.327.3 and Agent is available in Helm chart v2.5.3

### Control Plane v1.21.3

- Fixed broken documentation references in the UI.
- Fixes to SCIM server when removing admins assigned from an IDP group

### Agent v2.5.3

- Fix issue where executions were marked as successful if an accompanying `service` fails immediately.

## Monthly Release v1.21.1 (2025-12-10)

This release is available in Helm chart v2.327.1.

### What's new!

- **New Executions Dashboard!**
We've built a **Unified Executions Dashboard** that brings all your executions into one place, making debugging and monitoring significantly faster.
The new dashboard provides a single view with everything you need to work efficiently:
  - **Custom Views** & **Advanced Filtering**: Create private and shared views with comprehensive filter options, or use prepopulated views to quickly access common filter combinations
  - **Inline Details**: See all relevant execution information directly in the list without clicking into detail pages
  - **Live Data Toggle**: Control live updates to focus on current executions without interruption

  With this unified view, you can spot a failing execution, view its logs with one click, and act on it immediately. No more checking workflows individually or navigating through multiple pages to get the information you need. Plus, we've added several other features to make working with executions even easier.

  The **Executions Dashboard** is available via a dedicated icon in the left navigation toolbar.

- **Webhook Credentials Support** — Webhooks can now securely reference **Credentials**, so you can inject API keys and secrets into webhook URLs, headers, or payload templates using the ``credentials()`` expression instead of hard-coding them.

  This keeps your integrations with external systems (**Slack**, **incident tools**, **custom endpoints**, etc.) both safer and easier to maintain, since you can rotate or update secrets in one place without touching webhook definitions.

- **Deprecation of Tests & Suites** — Over the past year, TestWorkflows has become the recommended way to orchestrate tests in Testkube — offering more flexibility, better visibility, and continuous feature improvements driven directly by user feedback.

  To reduce complexity and make it easier to understand how to get started, we are now fully transitioning to TestWorkflows. Beginning with version 1.21, legacy Tests, Test Suites, Executors, and Sources are removed from the product.
  This ensures that all future enhancements benefit the most powerful and supported workflow engine in Testkube. Read more about the legacy deprecation [here](/articles/legacy-deprecation).

  :::danger
  If you are still using legacy functionality, you will need to stay on previous Testkube releases and migrate your Tests/Suites to
  TestWorkflows before upgrading to this release, as described in the [migration guide](/articles/test-workflow-migration).
  :::
  Join us on [Slack](https://testkubeworkspace.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2arhz5vmu-U2r3WZ69iPya5Fw0hMhRDg#/shared-invite/email)
  and we’ll guide you through the process. In the meantime, you can remain on version 1.20, which will continue receiving critical bug fixes while you complete the transition.

- **(Preview) Support for PostgreSQL** — As part of ongoing improvements to our data layer, we are introducing PostgreSQL as a new storage option.
This release includes PostgreSQL support in preview mode, which can be enabled through custom configuration documented
[here](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/install/advanced-install#using-postgresql-as-a-database) and [here](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/install/standalone-agent#using-postgresql-as-a-database)
PostgreSQL brings significant benefits in performance, scalability, and data security — laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

  Migration tools for existing Testkube installations using MongoDB will be provided in a future release!

### Improvements and fixes

- Silent executions tooltips and icon are more user friendly
- Updating credential now updates the correct credential scope when there is an override
- Added browser tab title to Execution Details Page

## Patch Release v1.20.4 (2025-11-20)

This release is available in Helm chart v2.326.4.

### Improvements and fixes

- Fix SCIM compatibility issue with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Patch Release v1.20.3 (2025-11-19)

This release is available in Helm chart v2.326.3.

### Improvements and fixes

- Fix SCIM issue where organization membership gets dropped for certain users.
- Add Silent Execution icon on Execution List.
- Fix broken dashboard executions link.
- Replace MongoDB and MinIO Helm charts with Testkube custom charts and images.

## Patch Release v1.20.2 (2025-11-13)

This release is available in Helm Chart v2.326.2.

### Improvements and fixes

- Insights APIs now respond faster thanks to smarter queries and better indexes.
- Workflow and credential flows feel more reliable across the UI.
- Deleting workflow executions is safer now that the process uses a configurable timeout (default 30m) instead of a rigid 5s timeout.
- Version check now correctly checks agent version.

## Monthly Release v1.20.0 (2025-11-03)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.326.0.

### What's new!

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Endpoint on Control Plane**
Building on the MCP Server introduced in v1.18,
you can now connect AI assistants directly to dedicated MCP endpoints on your Testkube environments,
no local CLI server required.

Configure your AI assistant (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Desktop) with your environment’s MCP endpoint URL and an API key,
and you’re ready to go.

Through this integration, AI agents can not only run workflows, monitor executions, analyze results,
and search execution history, but also modify workflows, access resource metrics for deeper performance and resource analysis,
and work directly with agents for advanced orchestration, all through natural conversation in your coding environment.

More info can be found in the [MCP Server](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/mcp-overview) page in the docs.

**Silent Executions**
Run workflows and tests quietly when you don’t want activity to affect your analytics or automation signals.
Silent Executions are now supported directly from the UI
and allow you to execute tests without persisting results in Insights, generating metrics, triggering CDEvents or webhooks, or impacting workflow health.

This is ideal for local development, debugging pipelines, experimenting with configuration changes, or running internal verification checks -
without polluting dashboards, reports, or automation workflows.

More info can be found in the [Silent Executions](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/test-workflows-running#silent-executions) section in the **Running Test Workflows** docs.

**Enhanced Credentials Management**
Managing sensitive values in Testkube just got easier.
We’ve introduced a unified credentials experience with improved organization- and environment-scoped credential handling,
along with dedicated management screens in both organization and environment settings.

You can now create plaintext or encrypted credentials and reference them directly in workflows using the `credentials()` expression,
making secure secret handling both intuitive and flexible across your Testkube environments.

More info can be found in the [Credentials Management](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/credential-management) page in the docs.

## Monthly Release v1.19.0 (2025-10-01)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.325.0.

### What's new!

**Concurrency & Queue Policies.**
This release adds new functionality to manage the concurrency and reliability of executions, allowing you to control the number of executions that can run
simultaneously across a single or a group of workflows. This helps you ensure that the number of tests running is always in line with the capacity of
both your testing infrastructure and the system-under-test.

**Runner Concurrency Limits** allow you to prevent overwhelming your runners with too many concurrent test executions. Whenever a concurrency threshold is met,
the execution will be queued until previous executions finish. Since the execution queue might fill up due to these concurrency features or because no online and
matching runners can be found, **Environment Queue Limits** help to prevent your workspace from getting overwhelmed. Once this limit is hit, executions will immediately
abort which will also trigger its web hooks for alerting. Lastly, **Execution Time-outs** will abort queued and ongoing executions respectively after 1 day and 7 days
with further fail-safes when runners are unable to gracefully abort.

[Read more about Concurrency & Queueing](/articles/test-workflows-concurrency-queueing)

**Listener Agents.**
This release introduces the concept of [Listener Agents](/articles/agents-overview#listener-agents) that allow you to listen for TestTriggers in multiple namespaces/clusters within a single Testkube Environment.
We added, a new `selector` field for Test Triggers enables agent-based filtering so you can filter out events from specific Agents and run triggers only in selected environments.

Under the hood, this release introduces a new capabilities model for the Testkube Agent that gives you granular control over how agents operate. Newly created agents can
register with runner and/or listener capabilities to fit your architecture.

[Read more about Agents](/articles/agents-overview)

### Improvements and fixes

- Improved overall filter handling to be consistent across workflows/templates and dashboard executions.
- TestWorkflows: Added support for dynamic runtime environment variable overrides via the `--variable` CLI flag.
- On-Prem: Fixed an issue where inactive SCIM users were incorrectly counted towards license quotas.
- Improved Agents page. You can view and install agents with different capabilities.
- Added OpenTelemetry Tracing to the Control Plane.

### Architectural Improvements

The team is working on some exciting architectural updates to make Testkube more scalable and reliable. Starting from this release, the
internal scheduling is changing from a push-based to a pull-based architecture. You should not notice much from this change, likely things
become more reliable when the connection between the control plane and agents is flaky. Another benefit is that this sits closer to Kubernetes
architecture, which will open interesting opportunities in the future. Stay tuned!

### What's new!

Latest release is live, bringing personalized views, streamlined enterprise integrations, and new AI assistant capabilities that let tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude directly interact with your test workflows.

**Private filters** let you **create personalized filter sets that only you can see**, separate from shared team filters. Access and manage your private filters through the new navbar section without affecting what others see.

**SCIM 2.0 enterprise integration** is now **fully multi-tenant and available on SaaS** for the first time. Configure identity provider integrations (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) **directly from Organization Management > Product Features** - no more Helm changes or service restarts needed for on-prem users.

**New Testkube MCP Server** enables **AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Desktop) to directly run and monitor Test Workflows**, analyze results, search execution history, and create workflows. AI agents can now help automate debugging and identify failing patterns right from your coding environment. [Learn more in the docs →](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/mcp-overview)

### Improvements and fixes

- Added dynamic filtering system that shows only available options based on current data to reduce interface clutter.
- CLI: Added support for SSO login, allowing users to authenticate the Testkube CLI with their organization’s identity provider.
- Agent Metrics: Expanded Prometheus metrics for Test Workflows and Execution Steps. Workflow execution metrics now include [additional fields](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/metrics#executions) (`triggered_by`, `tags`) for richer filtering and analysis, while new metrics for step-level duration and counts provide deeper visibility into execution details.
- Updated Usage & Billing page for SaaS product.

## Monthly Release v1.17.1 (2025-07-29)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.323.1.

### What's new!

This release focuses on usability improvements, better observability, and more powerful reuse of workflow templates.

You can now **filter workflow executions on the dashboard by name, labels, or status**, making it easier to focus on relevant runs during debugging, monitoring, or audits.

**Workflow Templates** now support **runner agent targeting** directly in the template spec. This allows you to define which Runner Agents should execute your workflows once, and reuse that logic across environments and pipelines. [Learn more in the docs →](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/test-workflows#runner-agent-target)

### Improvements and fixes

- Added workflow health status to the `status` subresource of the Workflow object, aligning with Kubernetes best practices and improving accessibility.
- Added `Canceled` and `Not Passed` events to provide better differentiation between manual stops and failed validations.
- Enabled verbose logging for the Control Plane API and added debug mode for Worker Service (`testkube-worker-service.enableDebugMode=true` in Helm values).
- Both `testkube-agent` and `testkube-runner` Helm charts are now being published to the OCI registry. They will remain accessible via the original Helm repository as well.
- Simplified network configuration by using the default Ingress for WebSockets used by clients. The separate WebSocket Ingress can safely be removed without requiring other changes.

## Patch Release v1.16.3 (2025-07-11)

## Monthly Release v1.16.1 (2025-06-26)

This release is available in Helm Chart v2.322.1.

### What's new!

This release comes with a new way to deploy Runner Agents and several improvements to workflows.

You can now install a Runner Agent using only Helm. Previously a Runner Agent had to be registered using the CLI or UI prior to Helm install. This feature can be used to create Runner Agents for ephemeral environments in a single step. [Documentation is available here](/articles/multi-agent-runner-helm-chart#self-registering-runner-agent-helm-install).

Users can now create custom views to group workflows by any criteria, making it easier to organize workflows that belong together or quickly access frequently used filtered results. These views are shared between all the users of a given environment.

We've added a [new Workflow Health indicator](/articles/workflow-health) that shows a quick visual summary of a workflow's recent stability, helping users understand how reliably it's been running over time, not just surfacing flakiness, but overall consistency. The health score is calculated as PassRate x (1 - FlipRate) and shown as an icon next to each workflow in both list and detail views, using weather-style visuals to represent different health levels.

We've introduced a new Canceled status to distinguish manual cancellations from system-level Aborted executions. Previously, both were marked as Aborted. With updated icons and messaging, users can now clearly see if a test Failed, was Aborted (system error), or Canceled (manual action).

Testkube Copilot has been renamed to Testkube AI Assistant to better reflect its purpose and avoid confusion with similarly named tools. This makes it clearer that the assistant is purpose-built for the Testkube ecosystem.

### Improvements and fixes

- Workflows search - Revised the way search works. You can now search for workflows using multiple words separated by spaces. The search matches when all the words are contained in the workflow name.
- CLI Artifact Download - Fixed authentication problems with certain cloud providers due to presence of duplicate authentication mechanism.
- Executions Logs - Improved horizontal scrolling for long logs.
- Insights - Fixed an issue where saving changes to an existing report saved a new one instead which led to duplicates.
- Fixed an issue where schedule links would navigate to the wrong workflow.
- Fixed an issue where the correct JUnit test suite icon wasn't displaying properly
- Improved the timestamps displayed within execution details when workflows are still queued.
- Improved handling of JUnit format when working with nested test suites
- Resolved a problem with empty string default values in workflow config settings
- Enhanced the agents dropdown for better usability
- Fixed an issue where your selected agents weren't being preserved when running workflows
- Corrected broken links in the running context that weren't properly directing to workflows
- Fixed a search error that occurred when searching for empty or non-existent values in execution logs
- Resolved a critical security vulnerability (F-2025-4481) related to OAuth account hijacking via redirect URLs

### What changed?

Release Quality has been our focus for Testkube v1.15.
This release is packed with a variety of bug fixes and improvements.

Our team also took a good look at the release procedures of the Testkube Control Plane:

- Changelogs! Testkube's control plane now comes with public changelogs and a unified version.
  In the past, each service such as the dashboard, API Server, workers, etc, would have its own version.
  Today they all share the same version which makes it easier to communicate changes and service interoperability.
- The release cadence will also be reduced to better fit enterprises. Moving forward you can expect a monthly minor release with some unplanned patch versions in between. The new process also improves predictability and stability of these releases.
- Our Helm Chart is now available as an OCI Artifact. The old Helm Repository approach still works, but under the hood it will now also pull as an OCI Artifact.

### Features

- Added timezone to TestWorkflows cronjobs.
- Added support for logging Audit Events to console.

### Improvements & fixes

- Fixed variety of security issues.
- Added downloading of an execution's log to the dashboard.
- Fixed an issue with preview URLs when changing environments.
- Fixed an issue with legacy tests events for the webhook condition selector
- Fixed an issue with full screen mode within execution dialogue.
- Fixed a problem where workingDir were incorrectly substituted within workflow definitions.
- Fixed an issue updating team and board descriptions.
- Fixed workflow termination when resource metrics cannot be stored due to lack of free storage space.
  Improved user interface of multi-agent engine
- Many other minor fixes and improvements.
