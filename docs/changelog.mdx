## Monthly Release v1.17.0 (2025-07-28)

This release is available in Helm Chart 2.323.0.

### What's new!

This release focuses on usability improvements, better observability, and more powerful reuse of workflow templates.

You can now **filter workflow executions on the dashboard by name, labels, or status**, making it easier to focus on relevant runs during debugging, monitoring, or audits.

**Workflow Templates** now support **runner agent targeting** directly in the template spec. This allows you to define which Runner Agents should execute your workflows once, and reuse that logic across environments and pipelines. [Learn more in the docs â†’](https://docs.testkube.io/articles/test-workflows#runner-agent-target)

### Improvements and fixes

- Added workflow health status to the `status` subresource of the Workflow object, aligning with Kubernetes best practices and improving accessibility.
- Added `Canceled` and `Not Passed` events to provide better differentiation between manual stops and failed validations.
- Enabled verbose logging for the Control Plane API and added debug mode for Worker Service (`testkube-worker-service.enableDebugMode=true` in Helm values).
- Both `testkube-agent` and `testkube-runner` Helm charts are now being published to the OCI registry. They will remain accessible via the original Helm repository as well.
- Simplified network configuration by using the default Ingress for WebSockets used by clients. The separate WebSocket Ingress can safely be removed without requiring other changes.

## Patch Release v1.16.3 (2025-07-11)

## Monthly Release v1.16.1 (2025-06-26)

This release is available in Helm Chart v2.322.1.

### What's new!

This release comes with a new way to deploy Runner Agents and several improvements to workflows.

You can now install a Runner Agent using only Helm. Previously a Runner Agent had to be registered using the CLI or UI prior to Helm install. This feature can be used to create Runner Agents for ephemeral environments in a single step. [Documentation is available here](/articles/multi-agent-runner-helm-chart#self-registering-runner-agent-helm-install).

Users can now create custom views to group workflows by any criteria, making it easier to organize workflows that belong together or quickly access frequently used filtered results. These views are shared between all the users of a given environment.

We've added a [new Workflow Health indicator](/articles/workflow-health) that shows a quick visual summary of a workflow's recent stability, helping users understand how reliably it's been running over time, not just surfacing flakiness, but overall consistency. The health score is calculated as PassRate x (1 - FlipRate) and shown as an icon next to each workflow in both list and detail views, using weather-style visuals to represent different health levels.

We've introduced a new Canceled status to distinguish manual cancellations from system-level Aborted executions. Previously, both were marked as Aborted. With updated icons and messaging, users can now clearly see if a test Failed, was Aborted (system error), or Canceled (manual action).

Testkube Copilot has been renamed to Testkube AI Assistant to better reflect its purpose and avoid confusion with similarly named tools. This makes it clearer that the assistant is purpose-built for the Testkube ecosystem.

### Improvements and fixes

- Workflows search - Revised the way search works. You can now search for workflows using multiple words separated by spaces. The search matches when all the words are contained in the workflow name.
- CLI Artifact Download - Fixed authentication problems with certain cloud providers due to presence of duplicate authentication mechanism.
- Executions Logs - Improved horizontal scrolling for long logs.
- Insights - Fixed an issue where saving changes to an existing report saved a new one instead which led to duplicates.
- Fixed an issue where schedule links would navigate to the wrong workflow.
- Fixed an issue where the correct JUnit test suite icon wasn't displaying properly
- Improved the timestamps displayed within execution details when workflows are still queued.
- Improved handling of JUnit format when working with nested test suites
- Resolved a problem with empty string default values in workflow config settings
- Enhanced the agents dropdown for better usability
- Fixed an issue where your selected agents weren't being preserved when running workflows
- Corrected broken links in the running context that weren't properly directing to workflows
- Fixed a search error that occurred when searching for empty or non-existent values in execution logs
- Resolved a critical security vulnerability (F-2025-4481) related to OAuth account hijacking via redirect URLs
- Strengthened security headers in our nginx configuration for better protection
- Fixed an issue where the Workflow wizard shows an empty preview when combining multiple templates
- Security updates in upstream dependencies.
- Fix API failure when deleting expired API token.
- Artifact cleaning via `ENTERPRISE_ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS` and `ENTERPRISE_ARTIFACT_MAX_STORAGE_SIZE_GB` now works as expected.

### What changed?

Release Quality has been our focus for Testkube v1.15.
This release is packed with a variety of bug fixes and improvements.

Our team also took a good look at the release procedures of the Testkube Control Plane:

- Changelogs! Testkube's control plane now comes with public changelogs and a unified version.
  In the past, each service such as the dashboard, API Server, workers, etc, would have its own version.
  Today they all share the same version which makes it easier to communicate changes and service interoperability.
- The release cadence will also be reduced to better fit enterprises. Moving forward you can expect a monthly minor release with some unplanned patch versions in between. The new process also improves predictability and stability of these releases.
- Our Helm Chart is now available as an OCI Artifact. The old Helm Repository approach still works, but under the hood it will now also pull as an OCI Artifact.

### Features

- Added timezone to TestWorkflows cronjobs.
- Added support for logging Audit Events to console.

### Improvements & fixes

- Fixed variety of security issues.
- Added downloading of an execution's log to the dashboard.
- Fixed an issue with preview URLs when changing environments.
- Fixed an issue with legacy tests events for the webhook condition selector
- Fixed an issue with full screen mode within execution dialogue.
- Fixed a problem where workingDir were incorrectly substituted within workflow definitions.
- Fixed an issue updating team and board descriptions.
- Fixed workflow termination when resource metrics cannot be stored due to lack of free storage space.
  Improved user interface of multi-agent engine
- Many other minor fixes and improvements.
