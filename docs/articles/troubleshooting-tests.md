# Troubleshooting Tests

## Introduction

Troubleshooting failed tests is a critical part of maintaining a robust testing pipeline—unless your tests never fail, in which case, hats off!

Before troubleshooting, you need to detect test failures, ideally via notifications from your CI/CD tools or collaboration platforms. Once a failure is identified, you’ll need access to:

- **Logs/Reports/Artifacts:** Generated by the testing tool.
- **Component Logs/Traces:** From the systems under test to help diagnose issues.
- **Infrastructure Metrics:** To address performance or network-related concerns.

## Key Challenges in Traditional CI/CD Environments

Collecting the necessary data in a traditional CI/CD setup can be daunting because:

- **Diverse Data Sources:** Different testing tools produce various types of logs and artifacts.
- **Custom Integration Needs:** Efficient analysis often requires custom scripting or additional tools for searching and comparison.
- **Manual Log Collection:** Gathering logs from the systems under test is typically a manual process that relies on log aggregation or APM tools. Identifying the affected components and the correct time window can be challenging.
- **Infrastructure Metrics:** Similarly, pinpointing the relevant performance data may require extra effort.

## Digging into Logs and Artifacts

After collecting the necessary artifacts, effective troubleshooting generally involves:

- **Filtering Noise:** Extracting the relevant information from the general “noise” in your logs.
- **Error Identification:** Searching for specific error codes or messages.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing current logs or results with previous (successful) runs to identify changes.

## Troubleshooting Tests with Testkube

Testkube simplifies the troubleshooting process with several built-in features:

- **Automated Collection:**  
  Automatically gathers [logs and artifacts](logs-and-artifacts) from your test executions and makes them available in the Testkube Dashboard.

- **JUnit Report Capture:**  
  If your testing tool outputs standard JUnit reports, Testkube will [capture those](../articles/test-workflows-artifacts#junit-report-extraction) for further analysis.

- **Enhanced Log Analysis:**  
  The Dashboard offers features like [Keyword Highlighting](../testkube-pro/articles/log-highlighting) and Log Comparison to help you identify relevant content quickly.

- **AI Insights:**  
  The [AI Insights](../testkube-pro/articles/AI-test-insights) module leverages GPT to analyze and interpret test logs, providing actionable insights.
