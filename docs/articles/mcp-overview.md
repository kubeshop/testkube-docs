AI-driven remediation using the Testkube MCP Server with Github and Vs-Code.

## Overview

The **Testkube MCP Server** brings Testkube's test orchestration capabilities directly into your
development environment and AI-powered workflows, enabling AI assistants and agents to interact directly
with your Testkube workflows, executions, and artifacts.

More specifically, it allows you and your AI agents to:

- **Execute and Monitor Test Workflows:** Run workflows, check execution status, and retrieve results
- **Analyze Test Results:** Access execution logs, artifacts, and failure details
- **Navigate Test History:** Search through past executions and analyze trends
- **Create and Manage Test Resources:** List workflows, view configurations, create workflows and access metadata

:::note
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to connect with external systems and data sources.

When used with agentic AI tools like GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4 in VS Code or Cursor, the Testkube MCP enables:

- **Multi-step Problem Solving:** AI agents can run multiple tools in sequence to solve complex testing scenarios.
- **Automated Debugging:** Agents can analyze failures, examine logs, and suggest fixes.
- **Intelligent Test Management:** Automated workflow creation, execution, and result analysis.

## Getting Started

Choose the setup method that works best for you:

### 1. Hosted MCP Endpoint (Recommended)

**The easiest way to get started** - Connect directly to the Testkube Control Plane without any local installation.

- ‚úÖ No installation required
- ‚úÖ Always available
- ‚úÖ Best for remote access and team collaboration
- ‚úÖ Works with any AI tool that supports SSE transport

**[Get Started with Hosted Endpoint ‚Üí](./mcp-setup)**

### 2. Testkube CLI

Run the MCP Server locally using the Testkube CLI for full control and local development.

- üîß Full control over the MCP server process
- üîß Best for local development
- üîß Supports stdio and shttp transports
- üîß Works with all MCP-compatible tools

**[Get Started with CLI ‚Üí](./mcp-cli)**

### 3. Docker Container

Run the MCP Server in a Docker container for containerized deployments.

- üê≥ Container-friendly deployment
- üê≥ Ideal for CI/CD pipelines
- üê≥ Easy to integrate with existing Docker workflows
- üê≥ Supports both stdio and shttp transports

**[Get Started with Docker ‚Üí](./mcp-docker)**

## Configuration Examples

Once you've set up the Testkube MCP Server, configure your AI tools:

- **[GitHub Copilot (VS Code)](./mcp-configuration#github-copilot-vs-code)**
- **[Cursor](./mcp-configuration#cursor)**
- **[Claude Desktop](./mcp-configuration#claude)**
- **[Custom MCP clients](./mcp-configuration)**

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides 20 tools for comprehensive Testkube management:

### Workflow Management

- `get_workflow` - Get workflow details
- `get_workflow_definition` - Get workflow YAML
- `get_workflow_metrics` - Get workflow performance metrics
- `create_workflow` - Create new workflow
- `update_workflow` - Update existing workflow
- `run_workflow` - Execute workflow

### Agent Management

- `list_agents` - List available agents for workflow execution targeting - [Read More](/articles/test-workflows-running#runner-agent-targeting)

### Execution Management

- `list_executions` - List workflow executions
- `get_execution_info` - Get execution details
- `get_workflow_execution_metrics` - Get detailed resource consumption metrics for a specific execution
- `fetch_execution_logs` - Get execution logs
- `lookup_execution_id` - Resolve execution name to ID
- `wait_for_executions` - Wait for executions to complete
- `abort_workflow_execution` - Cancel running execution

## Example Prompts

Once configured, you can interact with Testkube using natural language:

```text
List my test workflows and their recent execution status
```

```text
Help me debug my last failed workflow execution
```

```text
Create a new test workflow for my Python API and run it 
```

```text
Show me test execution trends for the past week and identify failing patterns
```

```text
Analyze the logs of execution "api-tests-123" and suggest fixes
```
