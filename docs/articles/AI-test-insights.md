# AI Analysis for Failed Workflows

The [AI-Assistant](/articles/ai-assistant-overview) available in Testkube can be used to analyse failed Workflow Executions, 
either by prompting it or simply selecting the corresponding "AI Analyze" in the Dashboard shown next to each failed/aborted Execution:

Selecting this will open the AI Assistant with a prompt to analyze the failed Workflow Execution as the input:

You could of course enter the same prompt manually and for any execution, not just failed ones.

The result of the analysis will be presented in the AI Assistant (use the expand button on the top right to see the full output):
