Testkube has built-in support for parallelizing any testing tool - check out the
[Parallelization](../test-workflows-parallel) documentation for details and examples.

The below example shows how to distribute ("shard") a set of Playwright tests across a configurable
number of nodes and aggregate individual reports into a single report that is available as an artifact.

The example below:

* Load the Git repository with Playwright test (`content`)
* Install the project dependencies (`steps[0].shell`)
* Run the Playwright tests split to 2 shards (`steps[1].parallel`)
  * Reserve 1 CPU and 1GB RAM for each shard (`steps[1].parallel.container.resources`)
  * Copy the repository and `node_modules` inside (`steps[1].parallel.transfer`)
  * Run Playwright test - with `blob` reporter, and with specific shard segment (`steps[1].parallel.shell`)
  * Fetch the Blob reporter's data to corresponding directory on Execution's pod (`steps[1].parallel.fetch`)
* Merge the reports using Playwright's tooling (`steps[2].shell`)
* Save the merged report as an artifact (`steps[2].artifacts`)
