# Basic Gatling Example

Below is a simple workflow for executing a Gatling test available on GitHub. You can paste this directly into the
YAML of an existing or new test, just make sure to update the `name` and `namespace` for your environment as needed.

- The `spec.content` property defines the path to the Gatling test in a GitHub repository.
- The `spec.use` property uses the official Gradle template to run the test with Gradle.

After execution, you can see the log output from the test executions under the executions panel tabs:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="logs" label="Log Output" default>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="artifacts" label="Artifacts" default>

The uploaded report is available in the Artifacts tab:
