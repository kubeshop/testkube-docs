# Workflow YAML Editor

This Definition panel under the Workflow settings provides a powerful YAML editor for editing your Workflows. 

:::tip
The editor uses the same editing component as VS-Code, so any editing features you are
familiar with from there should apply here also.

## Editor Actions

The toolbar at the top right provides the following actions (left to right):

- Search - global search and replace functionality, with regex, capitalization, etc.
- Undo / Redo / Copy
- Inline templates - to help you understand how used templates "play into" your Workflow by showing a side-by-side
  diff view of your Workflow with and without expanded templates (see example below).
- Full-screen mode - opens the editor in a larger panel, helpful for editing larger Workflows.

Furthermore, the editor provides an F1-popup menu with an extensive list of editor actions:
