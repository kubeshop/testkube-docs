# Test Workflows CLI Commands 

Test Workflows can be created and managed either through the [Testkube CLI](/articles/cli) or from the 
[Dashboard](/articles/testkube-dashboard-workflows-overview).

:::tip

Since Workflows are ultimately stored as custom resources in your clusters ([Read More](/articles/crds)), you can
also manipulate them directly using `kubectl`, for example `kubectl apply` can be used
to create a Workflow:

```shell
kubectl apply -f EXAMPLE_FILE.yaml
```
:::

## Create

```shell
testkube create testworkflow -f EXAMPLE_FILE.yaml
```

:::tip
Check out the [Create Workflow Wizard](/articles/test-workflows-create-wizard) to help you create new Workflows
for your existing tests using in your Git Repositories.
:::

## Get
The Test Workflow details can be displayed using `testkube get testworkflow` command using the Test Workflow name:

```shell
testkube get testworkflow TEST_WORKFLOW_NAME
```

### Filtering by Labels
Test Workflows can also be filtered using labels with `--label`:

```shell
testkube get testworkflow --label example=label
```

## Run
The Test Workflow can be run using the `testkube run testworkflow` command using Test Workflow name:

```shell
testkube run testworkflow TEST_WORKFLOW_NAME
```

This will start the Workflow execution asynchronously. 

If you instead want to follow the execution and see its log output as it runs, you can add the `-f` option: 

```shell
testkube run testworkflow TEST_WORKFLOW_NAME -f
```

:::tip
With the introduction of [Runner Agents](/articles/agents-overview#runner-agents) it is possible to add a 
`--target` argument to specify on which Runner a Workflow should be run - [Read More](/articles/test-workflows-running#runner-agent-targeting).
:::

## ReRun 

A previous Test Workflow execution can be rerun using the `testkube rerun twe` command providing Test Workflow execution id:

```shell
testkube rerun twe EXECUTION_ID
```

:::note
If the previous execution explicitly targeted a Runner that is no longer available, the execution will be queued 
until a corresponding Runner is available - [Read More](/articles/test-workflows-running#queuing-of-workflow-executions).

## Workflow Execution Status

Check the status of your Test Workflow execution using the Testkube CLI. For example:

```sh
kubectl describe testworkflow k6-workflow -n testkube
```

A sample output might look like this:

```

## Delete
The Test Workflow can be deleted using the `testkube delete testworkflow` command using the Test Workflow name:

```shell
testkube delete testworkflow TEST_WORKFLOW_NAME
```

## Using `tw` Alias

The `tw` alias can be used instead of `testworkflow` in all of the commands shown above, for example:

```shell
testkube get tw
```
