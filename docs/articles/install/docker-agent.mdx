# Testkube Docker Agent

The Testkube Docker Agent provides a convenient way to evaluate Testkube Cloud and can be run directly under
Docker without having to install or manage your own Kubernetes distribution.

:::info
The Testkube Docker Agent is not recommended for production usage - [Read More](#not-for-production-usage)
:::

## Resource Allocation

While the Testkube Agent itself does not consume a lot of resources, you should make sure you have allocated the
right amount of resources to your Docker Engine for the kinds of Tests you plan to run. We recommend to allocate at least
8GB and 2 CPUs for "simple" test executions (Postman, K6, etc.), and at least 16 GB and 4 CPUs for more
high-volume/distributed performance tests and E2E tests using Playwright, Cypress or Selenium
since these require a fair amount of resources themselves.

:::tip
If you prefer to use your own local Kubernetes cluster for the Testkube Agent, have a look at
[Testkube Agent with local Kubernetes](/articles/install/quickstart-no-k8s).

## Installation

### With Testkube CLI

Installing the Docker Agent with the Testkube CLI has the advantage of automatically configuring the CLI to work
with the Docker Agent, which would otherwise have to be done with the testkube set context command.

1. Install the Testkube CLI as described at [Installing the CLI](/articles/install/cli)
2. Run the below command:

```shell
testkube docker --agent-token=tkcagnt_XXX --org-id=tkcorg_YYY --env-id=tkcenv_ZZZ
```

You can get the required tokens from the [Agent Information tab](/testkube-pro/articles/environment-management/#agent-information).

### With Docker

Install the Testkube Agent using `docker run` with arguments provided in the Testkube Dashboard:

```shell
docker run --name=docker-testkube-agent --privileged -e AGENT_KEY=tkcagnt_XXX -e CLOUD_URL=agent.testkube.io:443 kubeshop/testkube-agent
```

(Starting the Agent the first time can take a couple of minutes)

:::note
The `--privileged` flag is required for the Agent Docker Image to provision its own Kubernetes runtime environment.
:::

Once running, the Agent will connect to the Testkube Control Plane and be available for running your Workflows.

### Checking Agent Status

You can use `docker ps` to check the Agents Docker status:

```shell
➜  ~ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS           NAMES
5c9f8f1eae58   kubeshop/testkube-agent   "tini -- /usr/local/…"   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes   2375-2376/tcp   docker-testkube-agent
➜  ~
```

### Accessing the terminal inside the Docker Agent

If you want to run `kubectl` (or any other) commands inside the Docker Agent you can use

```shell
docker exec -it <name> sh
```

for creating a corresponding prompt inside your Docker Agent.

### Starting and stopping the Agent

Use regular docker commands to stop and start the agent:

```shell
docker stop <name>
docker start <name>
```

## Using the Testkube CLI with the Docker Agent

To connect the Testkube CLI to the Testkube Agent running in Docker you will need to create an API Key
and then use that with the `testkube set context` command provided in the
[Environment Settings](/testkube-pro/articles/environment-management#agent-information) panel.

:::note
This is not necessary if you used the Testkube CLI to install the Docker Agent as described above.
:::

## Upgrading Testkube Docker Agent

There are two ways to upgrade the Docker Agent to the latest version

### Upgrading with the Testkube CLI

The preferred way to upgrade the Docker Agent is by using the Testkube CLI:

```
testkube upgrade
```

This will update the Testkube version inside your running Docker Agent (the Agent needs to be running for this command to work).

### Replacing the Agent Docker Image

This option comes with the drawback that you will lose any Testkube resources (Workflows, etc.)
that were created in the Environment using the Agent (since these are stored as CRDs in your Agents cluster).

1. Use `docker ps` to find the existing container id:

```shell
➜  ~ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS           NAMES
5c9f8f1eae58   kubeshop/testkube-agent   "tini -- /usr/local/…"   31 hours ago   Up 31 hours   2375-2376/tcp   docker-testkube-agent
➜  ~
```

2. Stop the image using the container id:

```shell
➜  ~ docker stop 5c9f8f1eae58
5c9f8f1eae58
➜  ~
```

3. Remove the image from the Docker engine:

```shell
➜  ~ docker rm 5c9f8f1eae58
5c9f8f1eae58
➜  ~
```

4. Pull the latest version of the Testkube Docker Agent:

```shell
➜  ~ docker pull kubeshop/testkube-agent
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from kubeshop/testkube-agent

Status: Downloaded newer image for kubeshop/testkube-agent:latest
docker.io/kubeshop/testkube-agent:latest
```

5. Now you're ready to reinstall the latest version of the Testkube Agent using the installation command [shown above](#installation).

### Exporting and re-importing Testkube Resources

If you're using the second method above and want to preserve any Testkube Resources you might have created in the Environment
your Docker Agent was connected to, you can export these using kubectl before replacing the Testkube Agent image.

```shell
docker exec
```

## Docker Agent internals

The Testkube Docker Agent provisions its own [Kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) inside Docker and then uses an
[entrypoint.sh script](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/blob/main/build/kind/entrypoint.sh) to set up its environment and install the Agent using Helm.

The Docker Image itself is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kubeshop/testkube-agent).

### Pod errors due to "too many open files"

If you encounter this error inside your Docker Agent you will need to increase the corresponding default settings
in your environment - [Read More](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files).

## Not for Production Usage!

:::info
Although the Testkuber Docker Agent is a great way to run Testkube tests in your infrastructure, it is **not** meant
for production or large-scale deployments as it is (very) constrained by the Docker runtime environment itself.

When deploying the Testkube Agent production or advanced evaluation purposes, please run the agent directly under a
Kubernetes instance, either locally or in a remote/hosted Kubernetes provider in line with the
[Installation Overview](/articles/install/overview).
