# Install with CLI

Following this quickstart tutorial provides you with a simplified On Prem installation that deploys both the control plane and agent within the same namespace. It does not create Ingress configuration as its mainly designed for local installations that allow you to quickly try out and evaluate the solution. It comes with a preconfigured admin, organisation and environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you can get started with our quickstart deployment you must install:

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster - If you don't have one [Evaluating Testkube without access to Kubernetes](quickstart-no-k8s.mdx)
- [The helm CLI][install-helm] to generate the Kubernetes YAML configuration.
- [The kubectl CLI][install-kubectl] to run commands against Kubernetes clusters
- The Testkube CLI for the quickstarter. For instructions, see the next section.

For the complete Testkube experience including the Dashboard and all related functionality you will need
to [request your free trial license](https://testkube.io/download) that will be needed during the installation process.

Alternatively, you can get started with just [the standalone agent][install-oss] which is fully open-sourced and does not require a license.

:::info
Why is a license is required? Obtaining a license helps us ensure you have an optimal installation and product experience with Testkube. Don’t worry - you won’t have to talk to a sales rep or enter any credit-card details to get going - but if you need our help we’ll be much better prepared!

## Install the Testkube CLI

You can choose one of the following methods to install the CLI:

<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS" default>

```sh
brew install testkube
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```sh
choco source add --name=kubeshop_repo --source=https://chocolatey.kubeshop.io/chocolatey
choco install testkube -y
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

To install the Testkube CLI you'll need the following tools:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), Kubernetes command-line tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

```sh
wget -qO - https://repo.testkube.io/key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://repo.testkube.io/linux linux main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y testkube
```

To install the Testkube CLI you'll need the following tools:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), Kubernetes command-line tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

```bash
curl -sSLf https://get.testkube.io | sh
```

<TabItem value="manual" label="Manual Download">

To install the Testkube CLI you'll need the following tools:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), Kubernetes command-line tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

1. Download the binary for the version and platform of your choice [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/releases).
2. Unpack it. For example, in Linux use `tar -zxvf testkube_1.5.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`.
3. Move it to a location in the PATH. For example:

```sh
mv  testkube_1.5.1_Linux_x86_64/kubectl-testkube /usr/local/bin/kubectl-testkube
```

For Windows, you will need to unpack the binary and add it to the `%PATH%` as well.

## Run the Testkube Installer

The installer will complete these steps:

- Check if you have chosen the right Kubernetes environment.
- Ask for some information, such as the previously requested license.
- Install Testkube’s control plane and agent, both within the same namespace.

The whole process takes 3-5 minutes and can be started with the following command:

```bash
testkube init demo
```

Once installed, you will be asked if you want to `testkube dashboard` to conveniently access all relevant services on your localhost. You can always execute this yourself afterwards should you close this terminal after installation. The admin in this demo has the following e-mail and password: `admin@example.com/password`.

Happy testing!
