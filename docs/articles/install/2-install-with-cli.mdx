# Testkube Evaluation Install

This step-by-step tutorial provides you with a simplified Testkube On Prem installation that deploys both the Testkube Control Plane and Agent
within the same namespace. It does not create Ingress configuration as it is mainly designed for a local installations that allows
a single user to quickly try out and evaluate the solution. It comes with a preconfigured admin account, Organization and Environment for running your tests.

:::tip
This evaluation installation is for a **single/local user only**, it is not configured to be shared with other users.

For a **production install**, please install with the [Helm Chart](install-with-helm) for more flexibility and configurability.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you can get started with the quickstart deployment, you will need the following:

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster.
- [The helm CLI][install-helm] to generate the required Kubernetes YAML configurations.
- [The kubectl CLI][install-kubectl] to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.
- The Testkube CLI for the quickstarter. For instructions, see the next section.

You will need to [request a trial license](https://testkube.io/download) that will be required during the installation process.

## 2. Install the Testkube CLI

You can choose one of the following methods to install the CLI:

<CliInstallation/>

## 3. Run the Testkube Installer

The installer will complete these steps:

- Check if you have chosen the right Kubernetes environment.
- Ask for some information, such as the trial license requested as noted above.
- Install Testkubes Control Plane and Agent, both within the same namespace.

The whole process takes 3-5 minutes and can be started with the following command:

```bash
testkube init demo
```

Once installed, you will be asked if you want to `testkube dashboard` to conveniently access all relevant services on your localhost.
You can always execute this yourself afterward should you close this terminal after installation. The admin in this demo has
the following e-mail and password: `admin@example.com/password`.

:::info
In case of issues with license please try `testkube diag license` command for license validation.

Happy testing!
