# How Can Copilot Help?

Testkube Copilot is designed to enhance your testing workflow through intelligent assistance. Hereâ€™s a closer look at what it can do:

1. **Log Analysis & Debugging:**

   - Ask questions such as "why did this execution fail?" or "write a short summary of what failed" to get detailed insights.
   - The Copilot can help pinpoint issues by examining log outputs and execution details.

2. **Dashboard Navigation Assistance:**  
   Copilot simplifies navigation within the Testkube Dashboard in two key ways:

   - **Page Finder:**  
     Request guidance like "where do I create an API token?" or "where do I check the audit log?"  
     The Copilot will respond with direct links to the relevant pages.
   - **Workflow Search:**  
     Ask queries such as "find all workflows that failed" or "find all successful cypress workflows and failed postman workflows" to quickly navigate to pages with pre-applied filters.

3. **YAML Configuration Assistance:**

   - Request examples or ask for help writing YAML configurations for Test Workflows and Test Workflow Templates.
   - Inquire about how to configure specific settings like services, workers, or parallelism within your YAML files.

4. **General Testkube Guidance:**
   - Whether you have questions about the Testkube Control Plane, Agents, or Dashboard functionalities, Copilot provides answers using our comprehensive documentation, complete with source links.
