# Testkube Quickstart

In this tutorial you will learn how to install Testkube, run your first Test Workflow, inspect its executions, and
integrate it with your CI/CD pipeline(s).

## 1. Install or Sign in to Testkube

Testkube has flexibility in its deployments (learn more at [deployment architectures](/articles/install/deployment-architectures)).
- **Testkube On-Prem** runs both the Control Plane and Test Execution Agents in your infrastructure.
- **Testkube Cloud** runs the Control Plane in our cloud and the Test Execution Agents in your infrastructure.

<Tabs groupId="tutorial-install-cli">
<TabItem value="on-prem" label="Testkube On-Prem">

1. [Install the Testkube CLI](/articles/install/cli)
2. Request a trial license at https://testkube.io/download.
3. Run the `testkube init demo` command in your terminal.
4. Run the `testkube dashboard` command to open Testkube without configuring Ingress.
5. Log in to Testkube with the credentials from the third step.

You will now see the Testkube Dashboard for the default environment created in your on-prem installation:

![The dashboard](./img/new-environment-dashboard.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Testkube Cloud" default>

  1. Sign in to [Testkube Cloud](https://app.testkube.io).
  2. Click on the `Let's get started` button.
  3. Enter an environment name and click `Create environment`.
  4. Run the generated `testkube pro init` command in your terminal to install the Testkube Agent.

  You will now see the Testkube Dashboard for your new environment:

  ![The dashboard](./img/new-environment-dashboard.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="demo" label="Testkube Demo Environment (no install)">

The Testkube Demo environment available in Testkube Cloud is a great way to explore the functionality provided by
Testkube without having to install anything in your infrastructure. It contains a large collection of Workflows for
different testing tools, with corresponding execution results and Test Insights for you to explore.

:::info
The Demo Environment won't allow you to follow the steps further down in the quickstart since
those steps require your own environment.
:::

1. Sign in to [Testkube Cloud](https://app.testkube.io).
2. Once authenticated, [go to the demo environment.](https://app.testkube.io/demo-environment) - (there are multiple in-app
  prompts for this also).

You will now see the dashboard without having to install an agent, and are free to explore/run existing Workflows,
look at execution results, etc.

## 2. Define your First Test Workflow

Let's take a look at a K6 load test to familiarize ourselves with Testkube's Workflows:

```yaml
# The workflow is a Kubernetes CRD with the usual apiVersion, kind and metadata.
# It configures the steps for your test automation pipeline.
apiVersion: testworkflows.testkube.io/v1
kind: TestWorkflow
metadata:
  # The workflow will have a name that you define here.
  name: my-test
  # By default, workflows should be applied to the namespace of the Testkube agent.
  namespace: testkube
  # Labels allow you to filter and group within the dashboard and CLI.
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: my-api
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: my-cms
    testkube.io/test-tool: k6s
    testkube.io/test-category: load-test
spec:
  # The content property allows you to fetch your test cases and source code.
  # You can check out content from Git or create specific files from strings.
  # In this case, we'll go for an inline test for simplicity.
  content:
    files:
      - path: k6.js
        content: |
          import http from "k6/http";
          import {
            textSummary,
            jUnit,
          } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-summary/0.0.2/index.js";

          export const options = {
            thresholds: {
              http_req_failed: ["rate<0.01"],
            },
          };
          export default function () {
            http.get("http://test.k6.io");
          }
          export function handleSummary(data) {
            return {
              stdout: textSummary(data, { indent: " ", enableColors: true }),
              "junit.xml": jUnit(data),
            };
          }
  # Workflows default to the container image's working directory. Often you will want
  # to update this to the directory of your content, but be mindful as some testing
  # tools might malfunction when their container's working directory is changed.
  # Git content is put in `/data/repo`, whereas relative file content in `/data`.
  container:
    workingDir: /data
  # Steps are the main building blocks in workflows. Each step is executed in sequential order.
  # You can use steps to setup or teardown your testing tool and test dependencies.
  steps:
    # Each step can run with their own image, yet the file system is shared across steps.
    # In this case, we'll run K6 on our test defined above.
    - name: Run k6 tests
      run:
        image: grafana/k6:latest
        shell: k6 run k6.js --iterations 100
    # Logs of steps are automatically stored whereas artifacts will require an explicit step.
    # You can give us the location of the artifacts and Testkube takes care of the rest.
    - name: Saving artifacts
      artifacts:
        paths: ["junit.xml"]
```

While this only scratches the surface of Workflows, we can now attempt to run this Workflow.
You can learn more about how to create and run you Workflows in the next steps.

## 5. Integrate with your CI/CD Pipelines

Testkube Workflow execution can easily be integrated in your CI pipelines, run on a cron schedule or trigger on a Kubernetes event.
For example, if I want to run this test every time my deployment's image updates.

<Tabs groupId="tutorial-integrate">

<TabItem value="ci" label="Trigger from CI/CD">

1. Browse to your Test Workflow within the dashboard - [Read More](/articles/testkube-dashboard-workflows-overview).
2. Click the `CI/CD Integrations` tab under your [Workflow Details](/articles/testkube-dashboard-workflow-details).
3. You can see the instructions where all variables have been prefilled for you.
4. Follow these instructions to run it on your favourite provider.

:::tip
Testkube currently shows instructions for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Tekton and ArgoCD, but can
  be integrated into any CI/CD pipeline by automating the [Testkube CLI](/articles/cli) or the [Testkube API](/openapi/overview).

## Next steps

_Congratulations on running your first Test Workflow!_

At this point you should have installed Testkube, run a sample test and integrated that within your pipeline.
Our recommended next step is to write run one of your own tests within Testkube.

To learn how to do this we recommend you either:

- [Follow a tutorial which adds tests to a sample application.][upnext-tutorial]
- [Create your test based on one of our workflow examples.][upnext-examples]
- [Dive deeper into the workflow documentation.][upnext-docs]
