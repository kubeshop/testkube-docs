| Evaluation Path | Goal | Persona | Intended for | Time to Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local Sandbox | To see Testkube run a test inside a local Kubernetes cluster with minimal friction | An individual developer or technical evaluator on their local machine | Exploring the UI, manual trigger points, using sample workflows, and understanding the contours of the product | â‰¤ a day |
| Team Evaluation | Install the full Testkube platform into a shared environment, running real tests | Team Lead, Senior DevOps Engineer, QA Lead | Orchestrating existing tests, tying into CICD, event triggers, and getting a real-world feel for the tool  | â‰¤ a sprint |
| Enterprise POC | Evaluate Testkube against enterprsie requirements like security, scalability, reporting, integrations, and in line with formal POC best practices | Engineering, DevOps, QA Leadership | Integrating test orchestration into strategic intiatives around quality, speed of delivery, and cost reduction | â‰¤ a quarter |

## Looking try Testkube without installation?

The Testkube Demo environment available in the Testkube Cloud Control Plane is a great way to explore the functionality provided by
Testkube without having to install anything in your infrastructure. It contains a large collection of Workflows for
different testing tools, with corresponding execution results and Test Insights for you to explore.

:::info
The Demo Environment won't allow you to create or update Test Workflows - to get the full experience, deploy the control plane today!
:::

1. Sign in to the [Testkube Cloud Control Plane](https://app.testkube.io).
2. Once authenticated, [go to the demo environment.](https://app.testkube.io/organization/testkube-demo/environment/testkube-demo/dashboard/home) - (there are multiple in-app
  prompts for this also).

You will now see the Dashboard without having to install an agent, and are free to explore/run existing Workflows,
look at execution results, etc.
