## Looking try Testkube without installation?

The Testkube Demo environment available in the Testkube Cloud Control Plane is a great way to explore the functionality provided by
Testkube without having to install anything in your infrastructure. It contains a large collection of Workflows for
different testing tools, with corresponding execution results and Test Insights for you to explore.

:::info
The Demo Environment won't allow you to follow the steps further down in the quickstart since
those steps require your own environment.
:::

1. Sign in to the [Testkube Cloud Control Plane](https://app.testkube.io).
2. Once authenticated, [go to the demo environment.](https://app.testkube.io/demo-environment) - (there are multiple in-app
  prompts for this also).

You will now see the Dashboard without having to install an agent, and are free to explore/run existing Workflows,
look at execution results, etc.
