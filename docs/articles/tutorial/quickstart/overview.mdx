# Quickstart Overview

Get started with Testkube in 2 steps:

1. Select which installation path below that is right for you.
2. Schedule a call with our Solutions Engineering team to get your evaluation license and answers to any outstanding questions.

## 1. Select an Installation Path

Select which installation path is right for you from the below options:

## 2. Schedule a call with our Solutions Engineering team

Once you've decided on your path (or if you're not sure), [Schedule time with our Solutions Engineering team!](https://testkube.io/demo) to get your evaluation license 
and get answers to any outstanding questions.

:::info
Don't worry - this isn't a sales call - we just want to make sure you get off on a good start with Testkube and answer any questions you have.
:::

## Looking try Testkube without installation?

The Testkube Sandbox environment available in the Testkube Cloud Control Plane is a great way to explore the functionality provided by
Testkube without having to install anything in your infrastructure. It contains a large collection of Workflows for
different testing tools, with corresponding execution results and Test Insights for you to explore.

:::info
The Sandbox Environment won't allow you to create or update Test Workflows - to get the full experience, deploy the control plane today!
:::

1. Sign in to the [Testkube Cloud Control Plane](https://app.testkube.io).
2. Once authenticated, [go to the sandbox environment.](https://app.testkube.io/organization/testkube-demo/environment/testkube-demo/dashboard/home) - (there are multiple in-app
  prompts for this also).

You will now see the Dashboard without having to install an agent, and are free to explore/run existing Workflows,
look at execution results, etc.
