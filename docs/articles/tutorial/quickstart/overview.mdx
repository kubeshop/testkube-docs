## What is Testkube?

import TwoColumns from '@site/src/components/TwoColumns';

<p>
    Testkube is a Test Orchestration and Execution Framework for Cloud-Native Applications. It provides a single
    platform for defining, running and analyzing test executions, using your existing testing tools/scripts,
    running in your existing infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>

    Testkube consists of a <b>Control Plane</b> and any number of <b>Testkube Agents</b>. The Control Plane exposes
    a <b>Dashboard</b> for easy and centralized access to most Testkube features.

  </p>

/>

- The Control Plane can be running either in the Cloud or On-Prem - [Read more](/articles/install/overview).
- The Agents run your tests and are _always_ running in your own infrastructure.
- The Agent is 100% Open Source and can also be run standalone without the Control Plane - [Read more](/articles/install/standalone-agent).

:::tip
Testkube has recently introduced the concept of [Multi-Agent Environments](/articles/install/multi-agent) - check it out to see how this can help you solve for
advanced test orchestration and executions scenarios.
