# Development

## Running with CRDs on a Kubernetes Cluster

The minimal component which must be deployed on your local
Kubernetes cluster is the [Testkube Operator](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-operator) with 
[Testkube CRDs](crds).

To install Testkube CRDs into your local cluster, checkout the testkube-operator project and run:

```sh
make install 
```

## Running on a Local Machine

The next critical components are the [Testkube API](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube) and an executor. You can use your own tests' executor or an existing one from Testkube.

Checkout the Testkube project and run a local API server:

```sh
make run-mongo-dev run-api
```

Next, run the [Testkube Postman executor](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-executor-postman). The postman executor is MongoDB based so it will launch MongoDB with the API server step:

```sh
make run-executor
```

### Making Calls to a Local API Server Instance

If you want to debug an API server locally, you can run a local kube-proxy which makes all calls to kube proxy URIs directly to API server instances.

```sh
make run-proxy
```

And when calling any of `kubectl testkube` subcommands, pass the direct client flag (`-cdirect`)


### Installing Local Executors

Install development executors by running them from the [Testkube project](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube):

```sh
make dev-install-local-executors
```

This will register Custom Resources for the following test types:

- local-postman/collection
- local-cypress/project
- local-curl/test

Create a `Test` Custom Resource with one of the types above to be executed on the given executor:

```sh
kubectl testkube create test --file my_collection_file.json --name my-test-name --type local-postman/collection
```

To summarize: `type` is the single relation between `Test` and `Executor`.

## Intercepting an API Server on a Cluster

For debugging on Kubernetes, intercept the whole API Server (or Postman executor) service
by using [Telepresence](https://telepresence.io).

Simply intercept the API server with the local instance.

To create/run tests pointed to in-cluster executors, start the API Server with telepresence mode:

```sh
make run-api-telepresence
```
