# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to integrate Testkube with external systems by sending HTTP POST payloads containing information about Testkube executions and their current state when specific events occur. To set up webhooks in Testkube, you'll need to have an HTTPS endpoint to receive the events and a payload template to be sent along with the data.

:::note
Please visit our Blog, [Empowering Kubernetes Tests with Webhooks](https://testkube.io/blog/empowering-kubernetes-tests-with-webhooks) for a tutorial on setting up webhooks for Slack and Grafana Dashboard.

## Benefits of using Webhooks in Testkube

Testkube uses webhooks to integrate with external systems, allowing you to effortlessly synchronize your testing workflows with other tools and platforms. These webhooks are designed to carry critical information regarding your tests as HTTP POST payloads. The information can include the execution and real-time status depending on how you configure it.

To leverage webhooks, you need to ensure that the platform that you want to send information to has an HTTPS endpoint to receive the events. Testkube also allows you to customize the payloads.

You can create a webhook from the dashboard, use the CLI, or create it as a custom resource. Before we show how it’s done, let’s understand a few scenarios where Webhooks in Testkube shine:

- Incident Management & Response: Webhooks can be used to create incidents and alert on-call teams when a critical test fails. This ensures a timely response and avoids any potential disruption due to failures and bugs. With Testkube, you can configure incident management tools like PagerDuty and OpsGenie to receive alerts based on critical events for your tests.

- Communication and Collaboration: You can configure Webhooks in Testkube to send alerts to your teams in your communication tool. This will notify your team of any critical event that needs attention and attend to it before the issue escalates. Some of the popular communications tools like Slack and MS Teams can be configured to receive alerts from Testkube.

- Monitoring and Observability: Webhooks can also be used to send alerts and notifications to your monitoring and observability tools like Prometheus and Grafana. This provides visibility into your tests, alerts you, and ensures that timely corrective actions can be taken.

## Creating a Webhook

The webhook can be created using the Dashboard, CLI, or a Custom Resource.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">
If you prefer to use the Dashboard, you can view existing webhooks by going to the Webhooks tab.

![Dashboard menu - webhooks icon](../img/dashboard-webhooks-icon.png)

Here you can also create a new webhook by clicking the `Create a new webhook` button.

Then, fill in the webhook details:

![Dashboard webhook - create dialog 1](../img/dashboard-create-webhook-1.png)

- Name - your webhook name (in this case `example-webhook`)
- Resource identifier - the resource (or resources) selected by `label` for which the webhook can be triggered (in the example: `test-type:postman-collection` - any postman test)
- Triggered events - events that will trigger the webhook (in this case `start-test`, `end-test-success`, and `end-test-failed`). All available trigger events can be found in the [Supported Event types](#supported-event-types) section.

![Dashboard webhook - create dialog 2](../img/dashboard-create-webhook-2.png)

Set your webhook URI - the HTTPS endpoint where you want to receive the webhook events.
After the webhook is created, the custom payload and headers can be set in Settings->Action.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
Webhooks can be created with Testkube CLI using the `create webhook` command.

```sh
testkube create webhook --name example-webhook --events start-test --events end-test-success --events end-test-failed --uri <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
```

`--name` - Your webhook name (in this case `example-webhook`).
`--events` - Event that will trigger a webhook. Multiple `--events` can be defined (in this case `--events start-test --events end-test-success --events end-test-failed`). All available trigger events can be found in the [Supported Event types](#supported-event-types) section.
`--uri` - The HTTPS endpoint where you want to receive the webhook events.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
```

Where <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL> should be replaced with the HTTPS endpoint URL where you want to receive the webhook events.

And then apply with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f webhook.yaml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Resource Selector (labels)

In order to limit webhook triggers to a specific resource, or resources, the Resource Selector can be used. It allows you to select the specific resource by label, or labels.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">

![Dashboard webhook - resource identifier](../img/dashboard-create-webhook-resource-identifier.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

The Resource Selector can be set with `--selector`.
For example, `--selector test-type=postman-collection` will limit the resources to the postman tests (label: `test-type=postman-collection`)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

```yaml
spec:
  selector: test-type=postman-collection
```

So, the complete definition may look like this:

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: test-type=postman-collection
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Webhook Payload

Webhook payload can be configured - in this example, `event id`:

```
{"text": "event id {{ .Id }}"}
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">
When you have selected an existing Webhook, its payload can be configured in Webhook Settings->Action.

![Dashboard webhook - webhook settings action`](../img/dashboard-webhook-settings-action.png)

![Dashboard webhook - webhook payload](../img/dashboard-webhook-payload.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
Create a webhook payload template file:

```json title="template.json"
{
  "text": "event id {{ .Id }}"
}
```

And set it with `--payload-template template.json`.

```sh
testkube create webhook --name example-webhook --events start-test --events end-test-passed --events end-test-failed --payload-template template.json --uri <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
```

Where <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL> should be replaced with the HTTPS endpoint URL where you want to receive the webhook events.

```sh title="Expected output:"
Webhook created example-webhook 🥇
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

Payload template can be configured with `spec.payloadTemplate`.

```
  payloadTemplate: |
    {"text": "event id {{ .Id }}"}
```

Example:

```
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
  payloadObjectField: ""
  payloadTemplate: |
    {"text": "event id {{ .Id }}"}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Webhook Payload Variables

Webhook payload can contain **event-specific** variables - they will be replaced with actual data when the events occurs. In the above examples, only the event `Id` is being sent.
However, any of these [supported Event Variables](#supported-event-variables) can be used.

For example, the following payload:

```
{"text": "Event {{ .Type_ }} - Test '{{ .TestExecution.TestName }}' execution ({{ .TestExecution.Number }}) finished with '{{ .TestExecution.ExecutionResult.Status }}' status"}
```

will result in:

```
{"text": "Event end-test-success - Test 'postman-executor-smoke' execution (948) finished with 'passed' status"}
```

#### testkube-api-server ENV variables

In addition to event-specific variables, it's also possible to pass testkube-api-server ENV variables:

```sh title="template.txt"
TESTKUBE_PRO_URL: {{ index .Envs "TESTKUBE_PRO_URL" }}
```

### URI and HTTP Headers

You can add additional HTTP headers like `Authorization` or `x-api-key` to have a secret token.
It's possible to use golang based template string as header or uri value.

### Helper methods

We also provide special helper methods to use in the webhook template:
`executionstatustostring` is the method to convert a pointer to a execution status to a string type.
`testsuiteexecutionstatustostring` is the method to convert a pointer to a test suite execution status to a string type.
`testworkflowstatustostring` is the method to convert a pointer to a test workflow status to a string type.

Usage example:

```yaml
  - name: TEXT_COLOUR
    value: {{ if eq (.TestSuiteExecution.Status | testsuiteexecutionstatustostring ) "passed" }}"00FF00"{{ else }}"FF0000"{{ end }}
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">

Webhook headers can be configured in Webhook Settings->Action.

![Dashboard webhook - webhook settings action`](../img/dashboard-webhook-settings-action.png)

![Dashboard webhook - webhook headers](../img/dashboard-webhook-headers.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
Custom headers can be set using `--header` - for example:

`--header X-Token="12345"`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

```yaml
spec:
  headers:
    X-Token: "12345"
```

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
  headers:
    X-Token: "12345"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure that the value `testkube-api.dashboardUri` in the helm-charts is set to `app.testkube.io`, or your remote dashboard URL, so that the variables above can be populated with the correct values.

## Additional Examples

### Microsoft Teams

Webhooks can also be used to send messages to Microsoft Teams channels.
First, you need to create an incoming webhook in Teams for a specific channel. You can see how to do it in the Teams Docs [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1). After your Teams incoming webhook is created, you can use it with Testkube webhooks - just use the URL provided (it will probably look like this: `https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/xxxxxxxxx`).

In order to send the message when test execution finishes, the following Webhook can be used:

```
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook-teams
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  events:
  - end-test-success
  - end-test-failed
  - end-test-aborted
  - end-test-timeout
  uri: https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/xxxxxxxxx
  payloadTemplate: "{\"text\": \"Test '{{ .TestExecution.TestName }}' execution ({{ .TestExecution.Number }}) finished with '{{ .TestExecution.ExecutionResult.Status }}' status\"}\n"
```

It will result in:

```
{"text": "Test 'postman-executor-smoke' execution (949) finished with 'passed' status"}
```

and the message:
`Test 'postman-executor-smoke' execution (949) finished with 'passed' status"` being displayed.

## Testing Webhooks

If you are just getting started and want to test your webhook configuration, you can use public and free services that act as HTTP catch-all apps. Here are a couple of options:

1. [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/): Beeceptor allows you to quickly capture HTTP payloads, review them in real time, and send desired HTTP responses as you test your webhooks. You can use its local-tunnel feature when you want to test payloads against a service running on localhost.
2. [Webhook.Site](https://webhook.site/): Webhook.Site provides an easy way to capture HTTP payloads, review the headers and body for the incoming requests, and automatically respond with a `200 OK` status code.

By using these services, you can quickly set up an HTTP endpoint to receive webhook payloads during your testing/development process.

## URL Masking

In the “Organization Management” section, under the “Settings” tab, there is an option called “Webhooks URL Masking.”  
When this toggle is enabled, it will mask the URLs of all webhooks displayed in the user interface.

![Settings - webhook url masking](../img/webhook-url-masking.png)

## Disabling Webhooks

Disabling webhooks can be helpful to make sure your team does not get spammed with notifications during development. Testkube lets you disable them via the CLI, the API or modifying the CRD directly. By default, webhooks are enabled on creation.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

The easiest way to operate on webhooks in Testkube is to use the official CLI.

#### Set on Creation

To disable:

```bash
testkube create webhook --disable --name "${WEBHOOK_NAME}" ...
```

To enable it explicitly:

```bash
testkube create webhook --disable=false --name "${WEBHOOK_NAME}" ...
```

#### Set on Update

To disable:

```bash
testkube update webhook --disable --name "${WEBHOOK_NAME}"
```

To enable:

```bash
testkube update webhook --disable=false --name "${WEBHOOK_NAME}"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">

When automating your operations on webhooks, you can also use the API. For more details, please consult the "Core OSS OpenAPI Definion" page, respectively the "OpenAPI Specification" for Testkube Pro and Enterprise, under the Reference tab on the left. The field specifying this on the webhooks is called `disabled` and is expecting a value of type `boolean`.

Keep in mind, that enabling the webhook again from the API will require specifying `"disabled":false`, simply deleting the field from the object is interpreted as not setting any value on it.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

Using the webhook from the example in creation, you can add the field `disabled` set to `"true"` to the specification:

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
  disabled: "true"
```

Apply with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f webhook.yaml
```

To enable a webhook again, you can either set the field `disabled` to `"false"` explicitly, or delete it altogether from the specification.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Disabling Webhooks on Other Resources

Disabling webhooks can also be done directly on an execution of a test, a test suite and a test workflow. This way the notifications can be disabled temporarily during running the execution. The CLI offers the flag `--disable-webhooks`, the API the parameter `disableWebhooks`. When not set explicitly, webhooks will be enabled by default.

#### Disabling Webhooks on Tests

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Use the flag `--disable-webhooks` on the CLI:

```bash
testkube run test k6-test --disable-webhooks
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">

The API expects a boolean value of the form:

```json
  {
    "disableWebhooks": true
  }
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The examples show only the `create` operations, however these instructions work the same for `update` and `run` as well.

#### Disabling Webhooks on Test Suites

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Use the flag `--disable-webhooks` on the CLI:

```bash
testkube run testsuite test-suite-1 --disable-webhooks
```

```json
  {
    "disableWebhooks": true
  }
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Disabling Webhooks on Test Workflows

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Use the flag `--disable-webhooks` on the CLI:

```bash
testkube run testworkflow test-workflow --disable-webhooks

```json
        {
            "disableWebhooks": true
        }
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The examples show only the `create` operations, however, these instructions work the same for `update` and `run` as well.

## Enable Webhooks on State Changes

It is possible to get notified by webhooks only when the latest execution's outcome differs from the previous one. This way you can see instantly when one of your scheduled tests was healed or when they got broken. It could also help prevent alert fatigue by deduplicating the alerts and therefore decreasing the load on your monitoring systems. Enable this by setting `onStateChange` to true directly on the webhook.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
testkube update webhook --name example-webhook --on-state-change
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```json
