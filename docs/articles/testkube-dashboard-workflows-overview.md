# Workflows Overview

The Workflows Overview displays all workflows (automated tests) in the **Environment** you selected. You can **Add a new Test Workflow**
and view and add **Workflow Templates**. You can also select individual workflows to view details such as **Pass/Fail Ratio**, **Failed Executions**,
and **Total Executions**. 

## Views

You can switch from the **Grid view** to the **Table view** for all workflows.

## Search and Filter

You can **Search** and **Filter** your workflows to narrow the output. You can also save search/filter criteria as views. For additional information,
read [Custom Views](../articles/testkube-dashboard-custom-views.md).
