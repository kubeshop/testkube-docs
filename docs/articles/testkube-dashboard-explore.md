# The Testkube Dashboard

The Testkube Dashboard provides a centralized user interface for managing your Testkube Installation. The Dashboard
is included in the Testkube Control Plane and available after installation either via local port-forwarding using the 
`testkube dashboard` command or via the NGINX Ingress Controller - [Read More](/articles/install/install-with-helm). 

When opening the Dashboard you will be presented with the following layout:

## Environment Overview

The top left icon takes you to an overview of the currently selected environment, as shown above. 

It contains:

- An overview of the Pass/Fail Ratio, the number of Failed Executions and the Total Executions (3).
- A scrollable list of most recent executions (4).
- Filters for narrowing down on specific types of executions (5).

Selecting an execution opens the corresponding [Execution Details](testkube-dashboard-execution-details)
