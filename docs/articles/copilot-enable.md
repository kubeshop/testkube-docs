This section explains how to enable or activate the Copilot feature for both Cloud and On-Prem installations of Testkube.

## How to Enable Copilot

The Copilot feature must be enabled by the **Owner** of the organization or an **Admin**.

Enable Copilot in one of two ways:

1. **Via the Initial Copilot Prompt:**  
   When you first access the Copilot, an initial prompt is displayed with action buttons that allow you to either enable the feature or keep it disabled.

2. **Through Organization Settings:**  
   Navigate to the **Product Features** tab in your organization settings and toggle the Copilot feature on.

Once enabled, Copilot will integrate with your Testkube Dashboard, ready to assist you and your team with your testing needs.
