# Testkube AI Agents

Testkube allows you to define AI Agents to perform advanced test orchestration and analysis tasks, using
both the internal and external MCP Servers for whatever scenario you need. 

Example Use Cases for AI Agents are:

- **Automated Remediation**: introspection of failed tests and related code changes to suggest fixes (see [Remediation Agent Example](/articles/remediation-agent))
- **Anomaly Detection**: analysis of execution results or resource usage over time to detect anomalies.
- **Advanced Integrations**: integrating with external systems via their MCP Server(s) for creating issues, sharing/reading data, etc.
- **Advanced Troubleshooting**: including externally available data for troubleshooting failed tests (see [Flakiness Analysis Agent Example](/articles/flakiness-analysis-agent))
- **Automated Test Generation**: Agents can both create new automated tests and the Workflows required to run them. 

The only limit to an AI Agents capabilities is set by the LLM you use and the MCP Servers you integrate with.

:::note
Testkube AI Agents use the same LLM that has been configured for the AI Assistant for resolving the provided prompt,
see [Default LLM and Model](/articles/ai-assistant-enable#default-llm-and-model).
