# Testkube AI Agents

Testkube allows you to define AI Agents to perform advanced test orchestrationa and analysis tasks, using
both the internal and external MCP Servers for whatever scenario you need. You can see an AI Agent as a 
packaging of an ad-hoc prompt performed with the [AI Assistant](ai-assistant-overview) that can be rerun 
whenever needed.

Example Use Cases for AI Agents are:

- Automated Remediation: introspection of failed tests and related code changes to suggest fixes.
- Anomaly Detection: analysis of execution results or resource usage over time to detect anomalies.
- Advanced Integrations: integrating with external systems via their MCP Server(s) for creating issues, sharing/reading data, etc.
- Advanced Troubleshooting: including externally available data for troubleshooting failed tests.

The only limit to an AI Agents capabilities is set by the LLM you use and the MCP Servers you integrate with.

:::note
Testkube AI Agents use the same LLM that has been configured for the AI Assistant for resolving the provided prompt,
see [Default LLM and Model](/articles/ai-assistant-enable#default-llm-and-model).
