# Testkube AI Agents

Testkube allows you to define AI Agents to perform advanced test orchestration and analysis tasks, using
both the internal and external MCP Servers for whatever scenario you need. 

## Example Use Cases for AI Agents

Example Use Cases for AI Agents are:

- **Automated Remediation**: introspection of failed tests and related code changes to suggest fixes (see [Remediation Agent Example](/articles/remediation-agent))
- **Anomaly Detection**: analysis of execution results or resource usage over time to detect anomalies.
- **Advanced Integrations**: integrating with external systems via their MCP Server(s) for creating issues, sharing/reading data, etc.
- **Advanced Troubleshooting**: including externally available data for troubleshooting failed tests (see [Flakiness Analysis Agent Example](/articles/flakiness-analysis-agent))
- **Automated Test Generation**: Agents can both create new automated tests and the Workflows required to run them. 

The only limit to an AI Agents capabilities is set by the LLM you use and the MCP Servers you integrate with.

:::note
Testkube AI Agents use the same LLM that has been configured for the AI Assistant for resolving the provided prompt,
see [Default LLM and Model](/articles/ai-assistant-enable#default-llm-and-model).

## Types of AI Agents

Testkube AI Agents can be designed with two distinct approaches depending on your use case:

### Task-Focused Agents

Task-focused agents are designed to perform a **specific task given specific inputs**, typically as part of an 
automated pipeline. These agents:

- Receive well-defined inputs (e.g., a workflow execution ID, test results, or error logs)
- Perform a specific analysis or action
- Produce a concrete output (e.g., post a summary to Slack, create a GitHub issue, update a dashboard)

**Examples**: An agent that analyzes a failed workflow execution, identifies the root cause, and automatically 
posts a summary with remediation suggestions to a Slack channel.

Task-focused agents are ideal for **automation scenarios** where you want to augment your Continuous Testing pipelines with 
AI-powered analysis and actions without human intervention.

### Guidance and Support Agents

Guidance agents are designed to provide **interactive assistance for general tasks**, acting more like an 
AI-powered assistant or copilot. These agents:

- Help users accomplish broader goals through conversation
- Provide recommendations, best practices, and step-by-step guidance
- Can perform actions on behalf of the user when requested

**Example**: An agent that helps users create new TestWorkflows by asking clarifying questions about their 
testing requirements, suggesting appropriate configurations, and generating the workflow definition.

Guidance agents are ideal for **onboarding, exploration, and complex configuration tasks** where users benefit 
from interactive support and contextual recommendations.

### Choosing the Right Approach

| Aspect | Task-Focused | Guidance & Support |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Trigger** | Automated (e.g., on execution failure) | User-initiated conversation |
| **Input** | Specific, well-defined data | Open-ended questions or goals |
| **Output** | Concrete action or artifact | Recommendations and assistance |
| **Interaction** | Fire-and-forget | Interactive, multi-turn |
| **Best for** | CI/CD automation, alerting | Onboarding, configuration, exploration |

Both styles can leverage the same MCP Servers and tools - the difference lies in how the agent is triggered 
and how it interacts with users or systems.
