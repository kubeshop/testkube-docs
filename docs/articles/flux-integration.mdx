# GitOps Testing with Flux

[Flux](https://fluxcd.io), a Kubernetes-native continuous delivery solution, is a leading tool for facilitating the GitOps process. It streamlines
application deployment management by continuously syncing the Git repository with the Kubernetes cluster.

With the integration of Flux into Testkube, it ensures automated and streamlined workflows for Kubernetes deployments and testing. When Testkube is
added to the GitOps process, automated testing is added to the deployment lifecycle. This approach cuts down on the time and effort needed for manual
work and speeds up the testing and deployment process, giving faster feedback and better application delivery.

## Flux Integration

Testkube can be integrated into a Flux-managed CI/CD pipeline, with Flux managing continuous application delivery and Testkube ensuring thorough
testing at all stages. Here is how to integrate Flux with Testkube for automated GitOps testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Testkube](https://app.testkube.io/)
- Kubernetes cluser
- [Testkube Agent](./install/multi-cluster.md) configured on the cluster
- [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/get-started/) is configured on the cluster
- Install the [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/)

#### 1. Configure the GitHub repo on Flux

Run the [flux bootstrap github](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cmd/flux_bootstrap_github/) command to deploy and configure the Flux controllers
on a Kubernetes cluster and link them to a GitHub repo for synchronization of the cluster's state.
Additionally, this command simplifies the process of pushing the Flux manifests to the designated GitHub repo.

**Note:** Before using Flux, create a GitHub [personal access token](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/github/#github-pat) (PAT) to be used later
for authentication.

#### 2. Export PAT

After the PAT is created, export it as an environment variable using the following command:

```sh
export GITHB_TOKEN=<gh-token>
```

#### 3. Configure Flux

Install the [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/) and run the following command to sync with the repo:

```sh
flux bootstrap github \
--owner=techmaharaj \
--repository=testkube-flux \
--path=cluster \
--personal
```

#### 4. Set up Git source in Flux

Add a Git source that specifies the repo and branch to be monitored for changes by executing the following command:

```sh
flux create source git testkube-tests \
--url=https://github.com/techmaharaj/testkube-flux \
--branch=main \
--interval=30s
```

#### 5. Create a Kustomization

Create [Kustomization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/) that instructs the Flux controller
to monitor the Git repo at regular intervals and sync the resources to the Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
flux create kustomization testkube-test \
--target-namespace=testkube \
--source=testkube-tests \
--path="cluster" \
--prune=true \
--interval=30s
```

#### 6. Verify Kustomization status

To verify if the sync was successful, use the following command to monitor Flux's progress and see if it
successfully synced the resources.

```sh
flux get kustomizations --watch
```

This command shows the status of the Kustomizations and continuously updates as changes are applied.

```sh title="Expected output:"
| NAME                    | REVISION           | SUSPENDED   |  READY     |  MESSAGE                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| flux-system             | main@sha1:a72cbbd4 | False       | True       | Applied revision: main@sha1:a72cbbd4  |
| testkube-test           | main@sha1:a72cbbd4 | False       | True       | Applied revision: main@sha1:a72cbbd4  |
```

#### 7. Verify Testkube Test Workflow creation

After confirming that the synchronization is successful with Flux, verify if the Test Workflow has been created in the testkube
namespace by using the following command:

`kubectl get testworkflows -n testkube`

```sh title="Expected output:"
| NAME                    | AGE       |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| basic-k6-workflow       | 3m38s     |
```

## GitOps Takeaways

Once fully realized, leveraging GitOps for Kubernetes application testing as outlined above provides a powerful alternative to the more
traditional approach where orchestration is tied to your current CI/CD tooling and not closely aligned with the lifecycle of Kubernetes
applications.
