# Gitops Testing with ArgoCD

:::warning
The features described in this document are being deprecated. You can find more details about the current Testkube features to perform these functions [here](../articles/legacy-features.md).
:::

The following is a step-by-step walkthrough to test the automated application deployment and execution of Postman collections in a local Minikube cluster.

Let’s start with setting things up for our GitOps-powered testing machine!

## Tutorial

### 1. Make sure you have Testkube installed in your cluster.

If you haven't installed Testkube in your cluster yet, visit the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started) for a walkthrough on installing Testkube.
‍
### 2. Install ArgoCD.

Follow the [ArgoCD Installation Guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).

Note: For step 3 in the guide, “Access The Argo CD API Server”, choose the “Port Forwarding” method, as that is the easiest way to connect to it with a Minikube cluster.

### 3. Install a “Hello Kubernetes!” application in your cluster.

We will create a YAML file for a simple `Hello Kubernetes` application that we will create our integration tests against.

Create the following `Deployment` file:

```yaml title="hello-kubernetes.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-kubernetes-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-kubernetes
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-kubernetes-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-kubernetes
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-kubernetes
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello-kubernetes
          image: gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

And deploy the `Hello Kubernetes` deployment with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f hello-kubernetes.yaml
```

You can test that your application has been correctly installed by running:

```sh
kubectl get svc -n default hello-kubernetes-service
```

### 4. Set up a Git Repository containing some Postman collections.

We are going to use tests created by Postman and exported in a [Postman collections file](https://www.postman.com/collection/).

We can upload this to the same Git Repository as our application, but in practice the repository could be the same repository hosting the application or it could also be in a separate repository where you manage all your test artifacts.

So let’s create our `hello-kubernetes.json` in `postman-collections` folder and push it to the repository.

```json title="hello-kubernetes.json"
{
  "info": {
    "_postman_id": "02c90123-318f-4680-8bc2-640adabb45e8",
    "name": "New Collection",
    "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "hello-world test",
      "event": [
        {
          "listen": "test",
          "script": {
            "exec": [
              "pm.test(\"Body matches string\", () => {",
              "    pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.contain(\"Hello Kubernetes\")",
              "})",
              "",
              "pm.test(\"Body matches string\", () => {",
              "    pm.expect(pm.response.status).to.equal(\"OK\")",
              "})"
            ],
            "type": "text/javascript"
          }
        }
      ],
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "header": [],
        "url": {
          "raw": "http://hello-kubernetes-service.default",
          "protocol": "http",
          "host": ["hello-kubernetes-service", "default"]
        }
      },
      "response": []
    }
  ]
}
```

You can see an example of how the repository should look [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-argocd).

### 5. Configure ArgoCD to use the Testkube plugin.

To get ArgoCD to use Testkube, we need to write a Config Management [plugin](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/config-management-plugins/#configmap-plugin). 
To do so, please nest the plugin config file in a `ConfigMap` manifest under the `plugin.yaml` key.

```yaml title="argocd-plugins.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm-plugin
  namespace: argocd
data:
  plugin.yaml: |
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ConfigManagementPlugin
    metadata:
      name: testkube
    spec:
      version: v1.0
      generate:
        command: [bash, -c]
        args:
          - |
            testkube generate tests-crds .
```

And apply it with the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f argocd-plugins.yaml
```
As you can see here, we’re using the command `testkube generate tests-crds` which creates the Custom Resources (manifests) that ArgoCD will then add to our cluster. 

### 6. Patch ArgoCD's deployment

To install a plugin, patch `argocd-repo-server` deployment to run the plugin container as a sidecar.

```yaml title="deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: argocd-repo-server
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: testkube
        command: [/var/run/argocd/argocd-cmp-server]
        image: kubeshop/testkube-argocd:latest
        securityContext:
          runAsNonRoot: true
          runAsUser: 999
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/run/argocd
            name: var-files
          - mountPath: /home/argocd/cmp-server/plugins
            name: plugins
          - mountPath: /home/argocd/cmp-server/config/plugin.yaml
            subPath: plugin.yaml
            name: argocd-cm-plugin
          - mountPath: /tmp
            name: cmp-tmp
      volumes:
        - configMap:
            name: argocd-cm-plugin
          name: argocd-cm-plugin
        - emptyDir: {}
          name: cmp-tmp
```

Apply the patch with the command:

```sh
kubectl patch deployments.apps -n argocd argocd-repo-server --patch-file deployment.yaml
```

### 7. Configure an ArgoCD application to manage test collections in your cluster.

Create the file that will contain the ArgoCD application.

```yaml title="testkube-application.yaml"
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
 name: testkube-tests
 namespace: argocd
spec:
 project: default
 source:
   repoURL: https://github.com/USERNAME/testkube-argocd.git
   targetRevision: HEAD
   path: postman-collections
   plugin:
     name: "testkube-v1.0"
 destination:
   server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
   namespace: testkube
```

Notice that we have defined the path `postman-collections` which is the test folder with our Postman collections from the steps earlier. With Testkube you can use multiple test executors like `curl`, for example, so it is convenient to have a folder for each. We have also defined the `.destination.namespace` to be `testkube`, which is where the tests should be deployed in our cluster.
‍

Now let’s create the application with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f testkube-application.yaml
```

### 8. Run the initial ArgoCD sync and check your cluster.

On ArgoCD’s dashboard, we will now see the newly created application. Let’s click to get into it and sync our tests.

![ArgoCD Testkube Tests](../img/argocd-dashbord.png)


And now click on `Sync` to see your tests created.


![Sync Testing](../img/argocd-sync.png)


Voilà! Our test collection is created and managed by ArgoCD with every new test created and updated in the GitHub repository containing the tests!

![Test Management with ArgoCD](../img/argocd-synced-tests.png)


### 9. Run ad-hoc tests from the CLI.

List the tests in your cluster with:

```sh
testkube get tests
```

You should see your deployed test artifacts:


![Deployed Artifacts](../img/list-tests-cli.png)


To run those tests execute the following command:

```sh
testkube run test hello-kubernetes
```


‍
The test execution will start in the background. Copy the command from the image below to check the result of the execution of the test:

![Cluster ID in CLI](../img/cli-get-tests-executions.png)

```sh
$ testkube get execution EXECUTION_ID
```

‍You should see that the tests have run successfully, as in the image below.


![Viewing Executed Tests](../img/cli-tests-results.png)

### 10. See test results in the Testkube Pro dashboard.

You can also see the results of your tests in a nice dashboard. Open the Testkube dashboard with the following command:

```sh
testkube dashboard
```


And you will be able to see the results of the execution in the Executions tab as seen in the image below:

![Test Execution Dashboard](../img/test-executions-ui.png)


We now have an automated test deployment and execution pipeline based on GitOps principles!

### 11. Allow adding ownerReferences to CronJobs metadata for Tests and Test Suites

You will need to enable the Helm chart variable `useArgoCDSync = true` in order to make CronJobs created for Tests and Test Suites syncronized in ArgoCD.

## GitOps Takeaways

Once fully realized - using GitOps for testing of Kubernetes applications as described above provides a powerful alternative to a more traditional approach where orchestration is tied to your current CI/CD tooling and not closely aligned with the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications.

We would love to get your thoughts on the above approach - over-engineering done right? Waste of time? Let us know on [our Slack Channel](https://testkubeworkspace.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2arhz5vmu-U2r3WZ69iPya5Fw0hMhRDg#/shared-invite/email)!
