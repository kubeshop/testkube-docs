    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of application audit logs
      description: >
        Fetch a paginated list of audit logs detailing actions performed on
        application resources.

        This includes actions such as resource creation, updates, and deletions,
        along with metadata

        about the entities involved and the context in which the actions
        occurred.


        The logs provide visibility into operations for auditing and compliance
        purposes,

        and may be filtered or limited by the parameters provided.
      operationId: listApplicationAuditLogs
      parameters:
        - $ref: './components.yaml#/components/parameters/ID'

  /organizations/{id}/audit/export:
    get:
      summary: Download an export of application audit logs
      description: >
        Download an export of application audit logs in a structured format,
        such as CSV or JSON,

        for the specified organization. The export includes detailed information
        about actions

        performed on application resources, including the entities involved, the
        context in which

        the actions occurred, and metadata about the operations.


        The export provides a comprehensive record of operations for auditing
        and compliance purposes,

        and can be used to analyze and visualize the history of changes to
        application resources.
      operationId: exportApplicationAuditLog
      parameters:

      summary: Returns a list of distinct values for the subject filter.
      description: >
        Returns a list of distinct values for the subject filter based on the
        provided query parameters.

        The subject filter is used to filter audit logs based on the entity that
        performed the action,

        such as a user, API token... This endpoint provides a list of distinct

        subjects that can be used to filter audit logs by the entity that
        performed the action.
      operationId: getAuditLogSubjectFilterValues

  /organizations/{id}/audit/keymap:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a keymap of application audit log types
      description: >
        Retrieve a keymap that provides mappings of various audit log
        attributes, such as event types,

        actions, entity types, and sources, for the specified organization.


        This keymap helps interpret the structure and meaning of audit logs by
        mapping internal identifiers

        to their corresponding human-readable descriptions. It can be used to
        facilitate the analysis and

        display of audit logs by providing context for different events,
        actions, and entities involved in the

        logged operations.
